1</span><i>EPISODE I</i><br />
&ldquo;STRICTLY BUSINESS&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In at least three inns, the landlords, on hearing the news,
spoke words of grave warning to their assistants.&nbsp; More than
one inexperienced tradesman, foolishly finding satisfaction in
the tidings, began to rummage eagerly among old accounts.&nbsp;
In the local police-station, the inspector instructed his
subordinates to stand no nonsense.&nbsp; And the harbour-master
removed his rabbits from outside his kitchen door to an apartment
at the top of the house.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Jane Gladys,&rdquo; after long absence, was back
again in her home port.</p>
<p>Doomed to pleasant disappointment, however, were such good
folks of Shorehaven as anticipated any spectacular ill-conduct
that evening on the part of the returned crew.&nbsp; Before the
rope fender of the despicable &ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo; had
rubbed the sides of the quay for five minutes, an atmosphere of
heavy gloom had settled upon the hardy mariners who peopled her,
and this though they had arrived in port in the best of spirits,
and were, moreover, furnished with several <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>half-formulated
plans of campaign which only awaited the inspiration of
environment to touch success in the form of financial or liquid
bonuses.</p>
<p>For the harbour-master, ever ready to placate the &ldquo;Jane
Gladys,&rdquo; was waiting on the quay for her with such
correspondence as had come addressed to her in her absence.&nbsp;
And Captain Peter Putt, taking his mail and sorting through it
perfunctorily, found his attention arrested by an envelope
imperatively marked &ldquo;Urgent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ripping it open, he glanced rapidly through the missive it
contained.&nbsp; This done, he pushed his cap to the back of his
head with a helpless gesture, blowing stertorously, and then read
the letter for a second time.</p>
<p>After that, he stared about the vessel for some while,
blinking incredulously.&nbsp; At last, with a comprehensive sweep
of his arm, he summoned his crew about him.&nbsp; Leaving their
labours to be completed by indignant hands on the quay, they
gathered round the plump little form of Captain Dutt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; announced the skipper, simply, &ldquo;the
show&rsquo;s bust!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a startled, perplexed silence, and then the voice of
Mr. Joseph Tridge rose aggrievedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What &rsquo;ave they been finding out about us
now?&rdquo; he wanted to know.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some folks is never
&rsquo;appy without they&rsquo;re trying to make mischief.&nbsp;
What are we supposed to &rsquo;ave done wrong now, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be that chap we sold the fish to in
Starcross,&rdquo; declared Mr. Horace Dobb, the cook.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because I saw &rsquo;im the night before we left, and
&rsquo;e never said a word about it to me.&nbsp; Kept &rsquo;is
&rsquo;ead turned stiff the other way all the time, in
fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was that chap in Teignmouth,&rdquo; recalled the
<a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>aged Mr.
Samuel Clark, uncomfortably.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know, what we sold
the&mdash;the tobaccer to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Im?&rdquo; returned Horace, the cook, with
scorn. &ldquo;&rsquo;E &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t got a leg to stand
on.&nbsp; I never told &rsquo;im it was smuggled tobaccer, did
I?&nbsp; I simply said it was stuff that &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t paid
duty.&nbsp; No more it &rsquo;ad!&nbsp; Serves &rsquo;im right
for jumping to conclusions, just because a sailorman&rsquo;s
carrying a parcel on a dark night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, boys,&rdquo; said the skipper, with a long,
quivering sigh, as one awakening to cold reality from a happy
dream, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all over!&nbsp; All over!&nbsp;
Itchybod!&rdquo; he remarked, with sad satisfaction in finding
the word. &ldquo;Itchybod, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;oo&rsquo;s &rsquo;e?&rdquo; truculently
demanded Mr. Tridge. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s &rsquo;e got to say
against us?&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ll take my oath I ain&rsquo;t ever
even &rsquo;eard of &rsquo;im before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a &rsquo;im,&rdquo; explained the
skipper.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit of clarsical learning
I&rsquo;ve picked up in Latin, and it means &lsquo;the
game&rsquo;s up.&rsquo;&nbsp; Boys, prepare for the
worst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of us?&rdquo; asked Mr. Horace Dobb, not without
apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of us!&rdquo; replied the skipper.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our
owner&rsquo;s giving up business, and &rsquo;e&rsquo;s goin to
sell all &rsquo;is ships!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there was a hush, and then, from the hinder spaces of
this period of shock, there crept forth the voice of Mr. Horace
Dobb, the cook, attuned to a sweet reasonableness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; he contended.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Just as if anybody would ever buy the old &lsquo;Jane
Gladys&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except,&rdquo; slowly said Mr. Clark, &ldquo;to break
&rsquo;er up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As some ill-omened sound in the still watches of the night may
paralyze its hearers into a cold, suffocating inaction, so did
the grisly words of Mr. Clark bring his companions to silent,
wide-eyed consternation.&nbsp; The <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>debonair Mr. Peter Lock was the first
to recover, but, though he roundly stigmatized Mr. Clark as being
a gloomy old horror, there was no elasticity in his tone, and his
effort to exhibit unconcern by lighting a cigarette was marred by
the manifest shaking of his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there it is, boys,&rdquo; presently said the
skipper, with an unconvincing attempt at briskness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as much a surprise to me as it is to you.&nbsp;
For myself, I shan&rsquo;t go to sea again after the next
trip.&nbsp; The owner&rsquo;s fixing me up a bit of a
pension.&nbsp; And as for you chaps well, if you&rsquo;ll take my
advice, you&rsquo;ll start looking round for fresh jobs without
delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;ll take some finding,&rdquo; stated Mr.
Horace Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Oo is likely to engage us off
the &lsquo;Jane Gladys&rsquo; I&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo; he
asked the skipper, with some indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some&rsquo;ow the fact that we&rsquo;ve sailed on the
&lsquo;Jane Gladys&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a
recommendation,&rdquo; mentioned Mr. Clark, regretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contrariwise!&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge, tersely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might be bought up and repaired and repainted and
refitted,&rdquo; ventured Captain Butt, but with no great
hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Er new owners would never keep us on,
though,&rdquo; frankly opined Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave &rsquo;eard too much about
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, hindeed?&rdquo; said Horace, loftily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, in that case, I don&rsquo;t know as I&rsquo;m
anxious to sail under folks what listen to gossip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luckily, we&rsquo;ve got a full week before we leaves
&rsquo;ere again,&rdquo; remarked the skipper.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll give you time to keep your ears open, and,
if any of you finds anything to suit you meantime, I shan&rsquo;t
stand in the way of you leaving when you want to.&nbsp; And
it&rsquo;ll be about <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>two months before the &lsquo;Jane Gladys&rsquo; is put up
for auction, so you&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave plenty of time to go on
looking round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so we shall after them two months,&rdquo; dismally
foretold Mr. Samuel Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;When first I come on this
boat, twenty-seven years ago,&rdquo; he told the skipper,
reproachfully, &ldquo;I was given to understand it was a
permanent job.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;d known&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there it is,&rdquo; said Captain Dutt, again
rather lamely, &ldquo;and it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited a little while, uncomfortably conscious of the
unhappy visages of his crew.&nbsp; Then, with symptoms of
commendable emotion, he scuttled to his cabin.&nbsp; The mate,
hitherto silent, addressed to the crew a few words of sympathy
with himself, and followed his superior.</p>
<p>The four sailormen of the &ldquo;Jane Gladys,&rdquo; bleakly
regarding each other, expressed their feelings in this crisis in
a sort of forceful, rumbling fugue.&nbsp; This done, they sulkily
retired to their bunks, to lie down and meditate over the
impending upheaval in their affairs.</p>
<p>But before long Mr. Clark began to snore challengingly, while
Mr. Lock sought distraction of mind by rising and performing a
number of arias on his melodeon, whereat Mr. Tridge, a slave to
music, sat up and joined his voice to the harmony in a melancholy
wail which he called &ldquo;tenor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Horace Dobb, the cook, was a man of temperament, and he
found himself keenly resenting these encroachments on his
ruminations.&nbsp; A person who openly plumed himself on the
possession of superior brain power, he now desired opportunity to
explore this gift to the fullest.&nbsp; Also, he had in his
pocket a shilling which he preferred to spend privily, rather
than in the company of Mr. Clark, who had but ninepence, or <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>of Mr. Lock,
whose sole wealth was fourpence, or of Mr. Tridge, who had
nothing at all.</p>
<p>Wherefore, then, Mr. Horace Dobb, crying aloud his utmost
annoyance at this disturbal of his peace, bounced from his bunk
and repaired to the bar-parlour of the &ldquo;Jolly
Sailors,&rdquo; a discreet inn on the quayside which gave promise
of being an excellent refuge where a man, equipped with a
shilling, and an anxiety about an unsettled future, might commune
comfortably with his thoughts.</p>
<p>In this sanctuary the cook of the &ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo;
remained for some while, with his cogitations becoming lighter
and lighter in texture with every lift of his glass, till
presently he had reverted to the normal, and was once again
looking on the world as nothing more formidable than a vast
territory bristling with chances for a quick-witted sea-cook to
grasp.</p>
<p>And, therefore, when the door opened to admit Captain Simon
Gooster, of the &ldquo;Alert,&rdquo; it was but natural that
Horace&rsquo;s bouyant imagination should present to him the
bulky figure of the new-comer as not being alone, but as stalking
in arm-in-arm with smiling Opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evening, sir,&rdquo; said Horace, very
respectfully.&nbsp; Captain Gooster nodded, glanced at the
measure which Horace had hastily emptied, and then,
disappointedly, glanced away again.&nbsp; Mr. Dobb ventured to
commend the weather, to which Captain Gooster responded,
absently, and, indeed, somewhat fretfully.</p>
<p>Horace at once conceded that doubtless Captain Gooster was
right, but the skipper of the &ldquo;Alert,&rdquo; passing on,
selected a seat in a remote corner and there posed
unsociably.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, dissembling his irritation, entered into casual talk
with another patron, who, it transpired, had <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>a precocious
child at home, an infant whose sallies so diverted Mr. Dobb that
soon his glass was being refilled for him by order of the
gratified parent.&nbsp; Immediately after, Horace&rsquo;s
interest in the prodigy seemed suddenly to wane, though this was
due less to thankfulness than to the fact that he had perceived
Captain Gooster to be looking at him in a concentrated and
speculative manner.</p>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s stare fascinated Horace, and continually
his eyes roved back to the skipper of the &ldquo;Alert,&rdquo;
and each time he accorded Captain Gooster a more ingratiating
leer on meeting his gaze.&nbsp; At last Captain Gooster beckoned
authoritatively and patted the empty chair beside him, whereat
Mr. Dobb readily sprang to his feet and took the indicated place,
leaving the sire of the infant prodigy indignantly helpless in
the very middle of a family anecdote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the cook of the &lsquo;Jane Gladys,&rsquo;
ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; opened Captain Gooster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At present, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eard about you,&rdquo; remarked
Captain Gooster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you &rsquo;ave, sir,&rdquo; guardedly
returned Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one they call &rsquo;Orace,&rdquo;
continued the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly, sir,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you, I ain&rsquo;t the kind of man
&rsquo;oo&rsquo;s fool enough to believe all he hears,&rdquo;
said the skipper of the &ldquo;Alert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; replied Horace, gratefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eard Cap&rsquo;n Putt say
you&rsquo;re a real smart, sharp, clever chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, of course &rsquo;e does know what
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s talking about, sir,&rdquo; observed Horace, with
the air of one making a concession.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eard old Peter Dutt keep on by
the hour about your cleverness and artfulness,&rdquo; said
Captain Gooster.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E swears you&rsquo;re a
wonder, and, if &rsquo;alf &rsquo;e says about you is true, so
you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, nodding his head, modestly refrained from
speech.&nbsp; Captain Gooster, as though he had satisfactorily
disposed of all preliminaries, sat back and stroked his chin in
thought for some moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I came across you to-night,
&rsquo;Orace,&rdquo; he said, at length.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man with
a &rsquo;ead-piece&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m looking
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that <i>is</i> lucky!&rdquo; declared
Horace.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking out for another job and
the &lsquo;Alert&rsquo; would just suit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I &rsquo;eard about the &lsquo;Jane
Gladys,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Captain Gooster, slowly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I wasn&rsquo;t looking out for a man for my
crew.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just a private matter.&nbsp; You
&rsquo;elp me, if you can, and as far as a pint or two
goes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me, sir,&rdquo; interrupted Mr.
Dobb, with dignity, &ldquo;but brain work ain&rsquo;t bought with
pints, nor quarts, neither.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m looking for a job,
not a evening out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; temporized the master of
the &ldquo;Alert.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If you needs a job and does
me a good turn, I ain&rsquo;t the man to forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir; and a gentleman&rsquo;s word is good
enough for me!&rdquo; stated Mr. Dobb, profusely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t ever regret taking me on the
&lsquo;Alert.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I can start this week with you, if
you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady!&rdquo; begged the startled captain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, you ain&rsquo;t even &rsquo;eard what the trouble is
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon settle it, sir, whatever it is,&rdquo;
vaunted Horace.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just you tell me about it, and leave
the rest to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Captain Gooster,
confidentially, &ldquo;to begin with, you must know I&rsquo;m a
widower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I see!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been a-carrying
on,&rdquo; diagnosed the cook, cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
we&rsquo;ll soon choke &rsquo;er off.&nbsp; I reckon, on the
&lsquo;Alert,&rsquo; you ought to pay me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A widower!&rdquo; repeated Captain Gooster, frowning at
Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s precipitancy.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t
mind confessing to you that I was disappointed in my
marriage.&nbsp; You see, I married for love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;&rdquo; commented Horace, shrugging his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she married me for my money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, women&rsquo;ll do anything for money,&rdquo; said
Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>Captain Gooster, sitting suddenly erect, dissected the
observation in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see what a disappointment it must &rsquo;ave been
for both of you,&rdquo; continued Horace.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Owever, let&rsquo;s &rsquo;ope you &rsquo;ave
better luck next time, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to!&rdquo; asserted Captain Gooster.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Marrying for love is a snare and a sham and a
deloosion.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve learned wisdom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Strictly
business!&rsquo; that&rsquo;s my motter in future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it ain&rsquo;t a bad motter, neither, sir,&rdquo;
approved Mr. Dobb, thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Strictly
business!&rdquo; he repeated, nodding his head over it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a jolly good motter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and next time,&rdquo; went on Captain Gooster,
&ldquo;I marries for money.&nbsp; And I may add, what&rsquo;s
more, that I&rsquo;ve got my eye on a certain lady
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;As she got &rsquo;er eye on you, though?&rdquo;
queried Horace, sagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She &rsquo;as.&nbsp; In fact, not to beat about the
bush, both of &rsquo;em &rsquo;as!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;Both of &rsquo;em?&rdquo; queried Horace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s two parties,&rdquo; explained the master
of the &lsquo;Alert.&rsquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m keeping my eye
upon both of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once I &rsquo;ad my eye on two parties at the same
time,&rdquo; recalled Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;One day they got
introduced to each other.&nbsp; And I went &rsquo;ome in a
cab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My two &rsquo;ave known each other all their
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they won&rsquo;t go on knowing each other much
longer,&rdquo; acutely prophesied Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they lives together in the same
&rsquo;ouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse me saying so,&rdquo; observed
Horace, civilly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got a dashed sight more
pluck than sense.&nbsp; Two in the some town is bad enough for
the &rsquo;eart, with all the excitement you get in turning a
corner when you&rsquo;re out with one of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; But two
in the same &rsquo;ouse&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mother and daughter, you see,&rdquo;
elucidated Captain Gooster.&nbsp; &ldquo;Goffley is the
name.&nbsp; Mrs. Goffley is a widow, and Ann&rsquo;s &rsquo;er
daughter.&nbsp; They live in Shorehaven &rsquo;ere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eard of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said
Horace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, they&rsquo;re new-comers.&nbsp; They bought that
little second-&rsquo;and shop what Meyers used to keep at the
corner of Fore Street.&nbsp; A snug little business.&nbsp; It
only wants a man be&rsquo;ind it, and it&rsquo;ll be a little
copper-mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve chosen yourself to be the man
be&rsquo;ind it?&nbsp; Good luck to you, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What with my little bit saved up, and my job on the
&lsquo;Alert,&rsquo; and the little shop earning profits at
&rsquo;ome, I shan&rsquo;t be doing so badly for my old
age,&rdquo; stated Captain Gooster, complacently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s just one little drawback&mdash;I shall
&rsquo;ave to marry one of them two females, and each time I
imagine myself married to <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>one, I finds myself wishing it
&rsquo;ad been the other.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve only to see
&rsquo;em both, and you&rsquo;d understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, which of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s got the money?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;That ought to settle the question
easy enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the trouble.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t find
out for certain which of &rsquo;em &rsquo;as got the cash.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eard rumours that old Goffley left all
&rsquo;is money to &rsquo;is daughter, with instructions to
&rsquo;er to look after &rsquo;er ma.&nbsp; And then I&rsquo;ve
&rsquo;eard rumours that &rsquo;e&rsquo;s left everything to
&rsquo;is wife, with instructions to look after &rsquo;er
daughter.&nbsp; Far as I can see,&rdquo; disconsolately ended
Captain Gooster, &ldquo;whichever of them females I marries, I
shall always &rsquo;ave the other as a burden round my
neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of &rsquo;em gives all the orders?&rdquo;
inquired Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Oo is the boss of the
two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They both bosses,&rdquo; returned the skipper of the
&ldquo;Alert.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And they both tries to boss
each other, most independent.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what makes it so
difficult.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve tried all ways to find out which is
the one I ought to make up to, but I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And
that&rsquo;s where I want your &rsquo;elp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Horace, softly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going to give me a job on
the &lsquo;Alert&rsquo; for, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you get this job settled satisfactory for me, and
you won&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave no cause to complain,&rdquo; promised
Captain Gooster.&nbsp; &ldquo;You be &rsquo;elpful to me and
you&rsquo;ll be &rsquo;elpful to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose you was to ask &rsquo;em straight out,
sort of joking like, which one of &rsquo;em &rsquo;ad got the
money,&rdquo; suggested Horace, but with no great confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tried that!&rdquo; retorted Captain Gooster,
curtly.&nbsp; &ldquo;No good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of &rsquo;em seemed most annoyed at the <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>question?&rdquo; asked Mr. Dobb, shrewdly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>She&rsquo;d</i> be the one &rsquo;oo &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t
got any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They neither of them said nothing.&nbsp; They just
looked at me, and I began to talk about the weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horace, leaning back, folded his arms and tightly closed his
eyes.&nbsp; Captain Gooster realizing that his companion was thus
incubating thought, forbore from offering further speech, but sat
waiting in some anxiety for demonstration of Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s
ingenuity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to take me up there and let me
see &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Horace, at length.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Introdooce me to &rsquo;em as the new cook you&rsquo;re
signing for the &lsquo;Alert.&rsquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll be the
truth, so it&rsquo;ll be quite all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&nbsp; A skipper introdooce &rsquo;is new
cook&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if they seems surprised at all, you can tell
&rsquo;em what a superior young man I am really, and &rsquo;ow
I&rsquo;m an old friend of yours, and so on.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the
only way I can do anything&mdash;I must see &rsquo;em
personal.&nbsp; Suppose I was to start making inquiries off the
neighbours, for instance.&nbsp; The fat would soon be in the fire
then, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matter of fact,&rdquo; confessed the skipper, with
reserve, &ldquo;there &rsquo;as been more gossip about already
than I care for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see &rsquo;em and keep my eyes open and ask a
question &rsquo;ere and there, most innocent, and I&rsquo;ll find
out the truth quick enough,&rdquo; boasted Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be too late to call on &rsquo;em to-night,
will it?&nbsp; Just about right, I should think; with luck, we
ought to catch &rsquo;em just at supper-time.&nbsp; You wait
&rsquo;ere, and I&rsquo;ll run back and tidy myself a
bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&nbsp; I should think that&rsquo;s the best
thing that can be done,&rdquo; said Captain Gooster,
ambiguously.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb took a swift departure to the &ldquo;Jane <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>Gladys,&rdquo; finding an empty fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle,
and thus being able to garb himself for ceremony without loss of
time in answering questions.&nbsp; Returning to the &ldquo;Jolly
Sailors,&rdquo; his improved appearance won a grunt of approval
from Captain Gooster, and then, together, the two men repaired to
their objective in Fore Street.</p>
<p>They found Mrs. Goffley and her daughter amid the ordered
confusion of the little second-hand shop.&nbsp; Captain Gooster
made Horace known to the ladies as an old acquaintance
unexpectedly encountered in the town.&nbsp; Introductions thus
achieved, the gentlemen were hospitably conducted to partake of
supper amid the more congenial surroundings of the back
parlour.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb claimed but little prominence in the talk, and,
indeed, seemed bent on eliminating himself as far as possible
from the interest of his hostesses, and this was rendered the
more easy for him by the fact that both ladies appeared to
concentrate their attentions on the skipper of the
&ldquo;Alert.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Dobb, however, was vigilant
towards all that was going forward, and when once or twice the
ladies bickered, he plainly submitted every word of their
spirited utterance to the closest analysis.</p>
<p>And when at length they left the house, Horace had arrived at
certain deductions, which he hastened to lay before Captain
Gooster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the old gal what&rsquo;s got the
money,&rdquo; he stated.&nbsp; &ldquo;She done the carving, for
one thing.&nbsp; And, for another, it was &rsquo;er that put the
coal on the fire.&nbsp; Besides, I ask you, ain&rsquo;t it only
reason that &rsquo;er late &rsquo;usband would &rsquo;ave left
&rsquo;er everything, knowing from the look of &rsquo;er that she
couldn&rsquo;t ever really &rsquo;ope to get married again?&nbsp;
No, I bet that rumour you &rsquo;eard was
right&mdash;&rsquo;e&rsquo;s left &rsquo;is money to &rsquo;is
wife, with instructions to look after &rsquo;er <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>daughter.&nbsp; P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps she&rsquo;s to
&rsquo;ave it after the old gal&rsquo;s popped off,&rdquo;
propounded Horace, delicately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but that&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;m frightened
of,&rdquo; said Captain Gooster.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose I married
the old lady, and one day she pegs out and the daughter gets the
lot?&nbsp; A nice return that &rsquo;ud be to me for all my
kindness, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s nothing to prevent the old lady
&rsquo;anding over the money to &rsquo;er second &rsquo;usband
while she&rsquo;s alive, to speckylate with, is there?&nbsp; And
once it&rsquo;s in your name&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Orace, if I could only think &rsquo;alf as clear
as you,&rdquo; remarked Captain Gooster, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be
driving my own carriage and pair by now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He halted, gazed back at the Goffley abode, and patently came
to decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait &rsquo;ere for me,&rdquo; he directed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to strike while the iron is hot.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m going to propose to the old geezer now and get it
over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He traced his way to the shop, knocked, and was
admitted.&nbsp; Scarce five minutes had elapsed ere he was again
at Horace&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; Captain Gooster&rsquo;s reply, in
response to an interested question, took the form of a fierce
growl of wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, she wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave you?&rdquo; asked
Horace, in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she &rsquo;ad me right enough!&rdquo;
exclaimed Captain Gooster, with extreme bitterness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s &rsquo;ad me proper!&nbsp; And
<i>you&rsquo;ll</i> get a job with me on the &lsquo;Alert,&rsquo;
I don&rsquo;t think!&nbsp; Clever?&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Smart?&nbsp;
Ha, ha!&nbsp; Sharp?&nbsp; Oh, ha, ha, ha!&nbsp; Why, I believe
your brains must be more like a wool mat than anything
else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if she&rsquo;s accepted you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accepted me?&rdquo; bellowed Captain Gooster, <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>passionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;She jumped at me!&nbsp; Put
&rsquo;er arms round my neck and made such a noise a-kissing of
me that &rsquo;er daughter come &rsquo;urrying in from the
kitchen at it!&nbsp; And Ann said it was ridic&rsquo;lous, and
Mrs. Goffley said it was love, and Ann crinkled &rsquo;er nose
sarcastic, and told &rsquo;er mother that I was simply marrying
&rsquo;er for &rsquo;er money, as any one could see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; cried Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
picked the right one, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit!&rdquo; urged Captain Gooster.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course, I says at once that I&rsquo;m pained and
&rsquo;urt by such a suggestion, and that of course I&rsquo;m
only marrying Mrs. Goffley for love.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sure?&rsquo;
she asks, smiling at me in a way what would &rsquo;ave been
tantalizing in a young gal.&nbsp; &lsquo;Positive certain!&rsquo;
says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Money,&rsquo; I says.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s money to me?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got plenty of
my own!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;There you are!&rsquo; she says to
Ann.&nbsp; &lsquo;Just as well though, ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
says Ann, with a sniff.&nbsp; &lsquo;Because, you know, ma, you
ain&rsquo;t got any money, &rsquo;ave you?&nbsp; It all belongs
to me, don&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, finding verbal comment inadequate, took off his cap
and shook his head helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when I &rsquo;eard that,&rdquo; narrated Captain
Gooster, &ldquo;the room sort of went round and round for a bit,
and the next thing I knew was that I was saying I must not keep
you waiting here any longer.&nbsp; And, with that, I stumbled
over the mat and left the place.&nbsp; And as for
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Alf a minute, sir,&rdquo; requested Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can see you don&rsquo;t understand
diplomaticism.&nbsp; You &rsquo;ave to run a few risks to start
with, and then you sets &rsquo;em right afterwards, when
you&rsquo;ve got what you wants&mdash;that&rsquo;s
diplomaticism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If <i>you</i> was to get what you really
wants&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;After all, sir, it&rsquo;s only what you asked me
to do,&rdquo; contended Horace.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Elp me
to find out which one of &rsquo;em &rsquo;as got the
money,&rsquo;&rdquo; says you to me, &ldquo;&lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll
give you a job on the &ldquo;Alert.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, I
<i>&rsquo;ave</i> &rsquo;elped you to find out.&nbsp; You know
now that it&rsquo;s the daughter what&rsquo;s got it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;ve been and proposed to the
mother!&rdquo; groaned Captain Gooster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve only got to change over,&rdquo;
suggested Horace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step back and say it was really Ann I meant to ask, I
suppose?&rdquo; groaned Captain Gooster.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just as if
the daughter would &rsquo;ave anything to do with me now!&nbsp;
Just as if the old &rsquo;un would let me off &rsquo;er
&rsquo;ooks now, the artful, deceiving old cat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could work up a quarrel with &rsquo;er,&rdquo;
prompted Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t the sort to quarrel till after
we&rsquo;re married,&rdquo; ruefully answered the skipper of the
&ldquo;Alert.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;After that, it&rsquo;ll be a
different story, I bet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, coming to a standstill, lightly tickled the nape of
his neck for some minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; he pronounced,
brightly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Call and see &rsquo;er to-morrow, and
speak to &rsquo;er as man to man.&nbsp; Tell &rsquo;er you made a
mistake, and it ain&rsquo;t love but only respect for &rsquo;er
old age!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;ll just answer me back snappy that she
ain&rsquo;t making a mistake, any way,&rdquo; prophesied Captain
Gooster.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, there ain&rsquo;t no way out, that I
can see, short of suicide.&nbsp; And,&rdquo; he added, lapsing
into extraordinary gloom, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I
wouldn&rsquo;t prefer <i>that</i> to that old gal with no money
be&rsquo;ind &rsquo;er!&nbsp; And as for you and a berth on the
&lsquo;Alert&rsquo;,&rdquo; he ended, <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>savagely, &ldquo;you just let me
catch you on board &rsquo;er for a single moment, even on a
visit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swung round and strode off, totally disregarding the
expostulatory noises of his companion.&nbsp; Mr. Dobb, thus
deserted, sauntered along in restive dejection, but suddenly a
greater decisiveness came into his bearing, and soon he was
cantering along in eager pursuit of the master of the
&ldquo;Alert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;now&mdash;now I <i>&rsquo;ave</i> got it,
sir!&rdquo; he puffed, catching up with Captain Gooster.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come to me in a flash, it did!&nbsp; You must take me
along to see the Goffleys again to-morrow night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Gooster violently mentioned a mutual meeting, which
involved considerable travel, as having priority over Mr.
Dobb&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must keep on taking me there,&rdquo; insisted
Horace, undaunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to make me laugh,&rdquo; observed Captain Gooster,
grimly, &ldquo;tell me what the idea is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll sink my feelings, and <i>I&rsquo;ll</i>
carry on a bit with the old gal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carry on with&mdash;&rdquo; gasped the
&ldquo;Alert&rsquo;s&rdquo; skipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make goo-goo eyes at &rsquo;er, flirt with &rsquo;er,
play slap-&rsquo;ands with &rsquo;er,&rdquo; amplified Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t give me a job on the
&lsquo;Alert&rsquo; after <i>that</i>&mdash;&nbsp; Why, chaps
&rsquo;as got medals for less than that!&nbsp; Far
less!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give you a job on the &lsquo;Alert&rsquo; for playing
slap &rsquo;ands with my missis-to-be?&rdquo; queried Captain
Gooster, in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and one day you catches us at it,&rdquo; sketched
Mr. Dobbs, knowingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you accuses us of
flirting, and you &rsquo;as a tremendous row with &rsquo;er, and,
though it breaks your &rsquo;eart, you casts &rsquo;er off!&nbsp;
And there you <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>are&mdash;free!&nbsp; And you can bet that quarrelling
with her ma will give you a good send-off to begin courting Ann
with.&nbsp; You can see that she&rsquo;s that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and what &rsquo;appens to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I get that job on the &lsquo;Alert&rsquo;,&rdquo;
answered Horace, simply.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can trust me to protect
myself safe enough where women are concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Gooster, weighing the pros and cons, could detect no
flaw in the scheme.&nbsp; Next afternoon, by appointment, he met
Mr. Dobb at the corner of Fore Street, and together they repaired
to the little second-hand shop.&nbsp; Enthusiastically did Mrs.
Goffley bid them enter and stay to tea, an invitation which was
signalized, rather than seconded, by a prolonged sniff from the
younger lady.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, now reversing his behaviour of the previous evening,
exhibited himself in the light of a sparkling blade.&nbsp;
Riddles galore did he propound to enliven the proceedings, and
many were the diverting anecdotes he furnished forth, though,
indeed, in some of these he checked himself, finishing them a
trifle lamely with endings which had the flavour of improvisation
about them.</p>
<p>His geniality, however, went far towards neutralizing the
acrimony of Miss Goffley, and by the time adieux were said
Captain Gooster was well satisfied with his confederate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;ve made a fine start,
&rsquo;Orace,&rdquo; he said, as they strolled together down Fore
Street.&nbsp; &ldquo;And to-morrow you must talk more
particularly to the old gal, so as to give me a chance to try to
make up a bit of the leeway with Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such heed did Mr. Dobb give to this instruction that <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>when, on the
following evening, they called at the little shop, he devoted his
conversation almost exclusively to the widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; was his patron&rsquo;s verdict, when
they left.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see she was a bit impatient at first,
but before long she was listening to every word you said.&nbsp;
Why, she never even noticed that I was talking quite a lot to
Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, and she was answering you, what&rsquo;s more!&nbsp;
I see you!&nbsp; What did you say to &rsquo;er?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Dobb, curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was just sort of generally mysterious and wistful
and &rsquo;eart-&rsquo;eavy, like you advised,&rdquo; replied
Captain Gooster.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I got &rsquo;er to confess that
there was a time when she &rsquo;oped&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;s as good as yours!&rdquo; joyfully
declared Horace.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the berth on the
&lsquo;Alert&rsquo; is as good as mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was during the following evening that there occurred a
startling development in the engagement of Captain Gooster to
Mrs. Goffley.&nbsp; Horace and that lady had been chatting
together gaily, and Miss Goffley was permitting the captain to
turn over her music at the piano for her, when suddenly the
skipper of the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; sprang to the centre of the
room and crashed both his fists down upon the table.</p>
<p>Mrs. Goffley, with an agitated squeal, tugged her hand away
from Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late, ma&rsquo;am, too late!&rdquo; thundered
Captain Gooster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;he&mdash;we&mdash;he was only telling me my
fortune!&rdquo; protested Mrs. Goffley, guiltily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see &rsquo;im telling it,&rdquo; retorted the
skipper, grimly.&nbsp; <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>&ldquo;Do you think I ain&rsquo;t got
any eyes?&nbsp; Carrying-on!&nbsp; Flirting!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
what you was up to!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t trouble to make up lies
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just because I was making myself pleasant to your
friend,&rdquo; began Mrs. Goffley, with spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go on making yourself pleasant to &rsquo;im!&rdquo;
recommended Captain Gooster.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done with
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I must say, ma, I&rsquo;m not surprised,
either,&rdquo; mentioned Miss Goffley, with a toss of her
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got witnesses to prove you was
carrying-on,&rdquo; said the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
the law on my side, and that&rsquo;s all I need.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
finished with you, ma&rsquo;am, and I wish you a very good
evening.&nbsp; Oh, a very good evening, indeed,
ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aloofly averting his gaze from the agitated dame, he hurried
from the house as speedily as possible.&nbsp; Horace, half an
hour later, came to him in the bar-parlour of the &ldquo;Jolly
Sailors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a proper bust-up after you&rsquo;d
gone,&rdquo; Mr. Dobb said, with relish.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, after
they&rsquo;d both &rsquo;ad &rsquo;istericks, things was a bit
quieter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mrs. Goffley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said it was good riddance to bad rubbish!&nbsp;
Said so over and over again.&nbsp; And now for business after
pleasure.&nbsp; When do I start on the Alert&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we sails at the end of the week, as you know, on
the same day as the &lsquo;Jane Gladys.&rsquo;&nbsp; You can come
then, if all goes well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I knew I shouldn&rsquo;t go begging for
long!&rdquo; said Horace, with considerable pride.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
knew I shouldn&rsquo;t be long finding something to suit
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall &rsquo;ave to get the Goffley business settled
first, though,&rdquo; hedged Captain Gooster.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to bring Ann up to the mark yet,
don&rsquo;t forget.&nbsp; Not that I <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>&rsquo;ave any fears, though.&nbsp;
Why, she&rsquo;s as good as said she&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my word, what a life them two women will be
leading each other for the next few weeks!&rdquo; exclaimed
Horace, with a shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall get Ann to keep quiet about our engagement when
we <i>are</i> engaged.&nbsp; And when we get married it&rsquo;ll
be by special licence, unbeknown to &rsquo;er ma.&nbsp; I can
afford it, if Ann&rsquo;s got the money coming to
&rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take my advice, sir,&rdquo; urged Horace,
earnestly, &ldquo;and rush your wedding through as quick as ever
you can.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you run any risks, for the old gal
will be doing all in &rsquo;er power to p&rsquo;ison the young
gal&rsquo;s mind against you.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s many a slip
between the bottle and the glass, don&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d get it settled to-morrow, if I
could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, luckily, I&rsquo;m still friends there,
don&rsquo;t forget.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m waiting to quarrel with the
old gal when it&rsquo;s more convenient.&nbsp; At present, she
just sits looking loving and &rsquo;opeful at me.&nbsp; And
I&rsquo;ll call round there to-morrow morning, first thing, and
get Ann to meet you somewhere, and you must persuade &rsquo;er as
&rsquo;ard as you can.&nbsp; Pack all the love you&rsquo;d make
in a ordinary engagement into three days, an&rsquo; get &rsquo;er
to marry you before you sails.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way to do
things, if you wants to be sure of &rsquo;er.&nbsp; And if you
wants any odd notes or messages taken to &rsquo;er, I&rsquo;ll
see to &rsquo;em for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose I wants to go near the
&rsquo;ouse, do you?&rdquo; asked Captain Gooster, with a
shiver.</p>
<p>And thus three more days passed, while the affairs of the
&ldquo;Alert&rdquo; were shamelessly subjugated to the claims of
Cupid.&nbsp; On board the &ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo; Horace was
watched vigilantly by his shipmates, and he maddened them with
constant veiled allusions to a most lucrative <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>and superior
berth which his talents and charms were securing for him.&nbsp;
Already had he handed in his provisional resignation to Captain
Peter Dutt, already was he bearing himself as a gentleman of
social standing far above that of his present companions.</p>
<p>Came the afternoon prior to the day which was to witness the
departure both of the &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Jane
Gladys&rdquo; from Shorehaven.</p>
<p>Captain Simon Gooster, passing up Fore Street, had on his arm
a lady whose countenance exhibited pride and triumph.&nbsp; For a
climax had been achieved at the registrar&rsquo;s office, and
Miss Ann Goffley was now Miss Ann Goffley no longer, but was, for
better or for worse, Mrs. Simon Gooster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to be flustered,&rdquo; said the
bridegroom to the bride, when they reached the little shop.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to break the news to &rsquo;er sooner or
later, and &rsquo;Orace &rsquo;as promised to be on &rsquo;and to
give us a &rsquo;elping word &rsquo;ere and there.&nbsp; She
can&rsquo;t let off all the steam she&rsquo;d like to&mdash;not
in front of &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be flustered if I like!&rdquo; insisted Mrs.
Gooster. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you start ordering me about!&nbsp; If
I ain&rsquo;t allowed to be flustered on my wedding-day, I should
like to know when I am allowed to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Gooster, after a glance of dawning uneasiness at his
bride, led the way through the shop.&nbsp; The new Mrs.
Gooster&rsquo;s mother was unsuspectingly laying the table for
tea, and Mr. Dobb, to the captain&rsquo;s relief, was seated in
the arm-chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; announced Captain
Gooster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Mrs. Gooster now,&rdquo; said the younger
lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Goffley.&nbsp; She
turned to Horace and giggled coyly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall we tell
&rsquo;em?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much to tell,&rdquo; returned Mr. Dobb,
airily.&nbsp; <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;Only that you and me was married, too, this
morning, by special licence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;!&rdquo; cried the skipper&rsquo;s wife, in
her turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite private,&rdquo; explained Horace, briefly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She even paid for the licence, so as to get it over
quick.&nbsp; I fancy she must &rsquo;ave guessed what you
and&mdash;and Ann was up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, there&rsquo;s no accounting for
tastes!&rdquo; said the skipper of the &ldquo;Alert.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Anyway, there can&rsquo;t be any cause for ill-feeling
between any of us now, can there? But, really, I don&rsquo;t
quite see, &rsquo;Orace, &rsquo;ow <i>you</i> come
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you two got married on the quiet, too, did
you?&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Dobb, with a curious glint in her
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you was wise.&nbsp;
Because, of course, you must &rsquo;ave known that I&rsquo;d
never &rsquo;ave given <i>my</i> consent, after the way you
treated <i>me</i>, Cap&rsquo;n Gooster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I knew that well enough,&rdquo; agreed the
skipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You married Ann for her money, of course,&rdquo; stated
the elder lady, dogmatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort!&rdquo; stoutly maintained Captain
Gooster.&nbsp; &ldquo;Love&mdash;nothing but love!&nbsp; It was
because I&rsquo;d found out that it was &rsquo;er I really loved
all the time that I broke it off with you.&nbsp; If Ann
&rsquo;adn&rsquo;t got a single penny coming to
&rsquo;er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Mrs. Dobb, with
emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to frighten me?&rdquo; suggested the smiling
captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, you admitted to me yourself that it
was &rsquo;er that &rsquo;ad all the money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she &rsquo;ad,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Gooster&rsquo;s
mother&mdash;&ldquo;<i>then</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;then?&rdquo; asked the captain,
thickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it was all to be &rsquo;ers,&rdquo; explained the
new Mrs. <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>Dobb, &ldquo;unless she married without my
consent.&nbsp; My &rsquo;usband arranged it like that to protect
&rsquo;er from fortune &rsquo;unters, and very lucky &rsquo;e
did, too!&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t shake your &rsquo;ead!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s all quite true.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s a copy of my
&rsquo;usband&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; I showed it to Dobb &rsquo;ere
when &rsquo;e was trying to console me that evening after
you&rsquo;d left&mdash;you know, when you threw me
over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you <i>knew</i> when you advised me
to&mdash;&rdquo; roared the skipper, wheeling on Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; shamelessly admitted Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Part of it I worked out, and part of it worked itself out
for me!&nbsp; You see, I&mdash;I &rsquo;appened to fall genuine
in love with my new wife &rsquo;ere and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t trouble to tell lies about it!&rdquo;
shouted the skipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you roar at my &rsquo;usband like that,
neither!&rdquo; ordered the elder lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I may as
well tell you that I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave taken &rsquo;im if I
&rsquo;ated &rsquo;im&mdash;I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave taken the first
man what come along!&nbsp; Anything to let you see you
wasn&rsquo;t the only chance I&rsquo;d got!&nbsp;
And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but what becomes of the money that should
&rsquo;ave been &rsquo;ers&mdash;the money you&rsquo;ve diddled
me out of?&rdquo; cried the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Horace, softly, &ldquo;it just stays
with <i>us</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you knew this when you advised me to get married on
the quiet to Ann, yonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certingly,&rdquo; said the unabashed Horace.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we both agree that &lsquo;Strictly
Business!&rsquo; was a jolly good motter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; went on the skipper, wheeling on his
bride&mdash;&ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t tell me nothing, for fear of
losing me?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&ldquo;And so I should have,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you stare at me like that, neither!&nbsp;
If you think that I&rsquo;m the kind of wife that can be bullied,
you&rsquo;re making a big mistake!&nbsp; And now I&rsquo;ll get
my portmanteau, and you can take me down to your cabin on the
&lsquo;Alert.&rsquo;&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going
to stay on in the house with these people, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, any time you&rsquo;re passing,&rdquo; said the
cook, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be pleased to welcome my stepdaughter and
my son-in-law.&nbsp; <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t bear no ill-will, and I
shouldn&rsquo;t like to think that others would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve lost your berth on the
&lsquo;Alert,&rsquo; any way,&rdquo; said Captain Gooster,
inadequately.&nbsp; &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d
&rsquo;ave you now, because I shouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I couldn&rsquo;t accept it, in any
case,&rdquo; said Mr. Horace Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Oo&rsquo;s
to look after the shop?&nbsp; You said yourself that it needed a
man, and I&rsquo;ve provided myself for it.&nbsp; And you know
&rsquo;ow useful I can make myself, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>That evening, when Messrs. Lock and Tridge and Clark, hearing
something of what had transpired, trooped down to Fore Street to
find Horace, they discovered him already engaged in bringing the
stock and fixtures into line with his own ideas on such
matters.</p>
<p>Very readily he told them the tale of his marriage, and,
further, pointed out that the future might hold many occasions
when his shipmates of the &ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo; might find it
profitable to link their talents temporarily to the fortunes of
the little second-hand shop.</p>
<p>But when Mr. Tridge remarked that the &ldquo;Jane
Gladys&rdquo; was sailing early on the morrow, and that <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>therefore a
little loan would be both acceptable and timely to her crew, Mr.
Horace Dobb did not reply in words.</p>
<p>Instead, he stood erect and pointed over his shoulder, with a
jerk of his thumb, at a notice which he had been at some pains to
illuminate on a panel of wood, and which now hung conspicuously
on the wall of the little shop.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Messrs. Lock, Tridge, and Clark turned to
regard the board.&nbsp; It bore the simple legend,
&ldquo;<i>Strictly Business</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span><i>EPISODE II</i><br />
A WATCHING BRIEF</h2>
<p>Mr. Peter Lock, in the bowels of the &ldquo;Jane
Gladys,&rdquo; had attired himself for outdoor promenade with a
meticulous attention to detail which had spurred Mr. Joseph
Tridge to scornful mention of beauty-doctors and mashers and
tailors&rsquo; dummies.&nbsp; Mr. Lock, in no wise offended by
these oblique compliments to his appearance, had finally lingered
for a full half-minute before the cracked little mirror in
fastidious self-examination, and then had gone ashore for the
express purpose of keeping an appointment with a friend.&nbsp;
Five minutes later he reappeared.&nbsp; He explained that a
complication had arisen, for his friend had brought a friend with
her to the trysting-place, so that another gentleman was now
indispensable to secure balance to the party.&nbsp; As the result
of eloquent appeals and lavish promises, Mr. Tridge was
reluctantly impressed into the role of temporary friend to the
friend&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>Matters thus adjusted, Messrs. Tridge and Lock departed,
leaving the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle of the &ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo;
empty but for the brooding figure of the stout and aged Mr.
Samuel Clark.</p>
<p>For a long while Mr. Clark sat on the edge of his bunk,
wrapped in doleful reverie, and motionless save when, from time
to time, a deep sigh agitated his vast shoulders.&nbsp; At last,
however, a well-remembered whistle <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>sounded from the quay, and instantly
roused Mr. Clark from his gloomy meditations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Orace!&rdquo; he exclaimed, sitting erect, and
his eyes began to gleam with a dawning hopefulness.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Mr. Horace Dobb descended into that
fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle wherein aforetime he had been so prominent a
dweller, though now it needed strong imagination to believe that,
less than three weeks ago, he had served the &ldquo;Jane
Gladys&rdquo; in such a menial capacity as cook.&nbsp; For Mr.
Dobb was wearing a horseshoe pin and a massive watch-chain, and a
soft hat of adventurous aspect.&nbsp; He carried a bloated
umbrella which had somehow acquired a quality of being a
mace-like symbol of authority.&nbsp; And, also, Mr. Dobb was
smoking a cigar.</p>
<p>In short, he presented a visible proof that marriage need not
invariably be a failure, provided that one selects as bride a
manageable widow with a snug little business of her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doing the Cinderella hact all by yourself, are
you?&rdquo; observed Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be
better.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve brought some one on purpose to see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could trot across to the &lsquo;Jolly Sailors&rsquo;
and get&mdash;&rdquo; began Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;At
least,&rdquo; he amended, ingenuously, &ldquo;if I &rsquo;ad any
money I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessary,&rdquo; stated Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s a teetotaller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A teetotaller?&rdquo; echoed Mr. Clark, suspiciously.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, what&rsquo;s the game&mdash;bringing a
teetotaller to see <i>me</i>?&nbsp; &rsquo;Strewth,
&rsquo;Orace!&rdquo; he cried, in sudden alarm. &ldquo;You
ain&rsquo;t going to tell me that being well-off &rsquo;as gone
to your &rsquo;ead and given you silly ideas, are you?&nbsp; You
ain&rsquo;t going to tell me that you&rsquo;ve turned
teetotaller, too, and the pair of you &rsquo;ave come down to try
and <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>convert me?&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave it!&rdquo; he
declared, wrathfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to
&rsquo;ave no one trying to meddle about with my constitootion,
never mind &rsquo;ow old a friend &rsquo;e is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t <i>you</i> start thinking evil of
<i>me</i>!&rdquo; returned Mr. Dobb, with spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave it, neither!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; protested Mr. Clark, significantly,
&ldquo;<i>you</i> a-going about with teetotallers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps it do look fishy,&rdquo;
conceded Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you oughter know me better
than that!&nbsp; You know me motter, Sam, don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp;
&lsquo;Strictly Business!&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, my friendship with
&rsquo;im is strictly business.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t suppose I
could ever &rsquo;ave a friendly friendship with a teetotaller,
do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should &rsquo;ope not, indeed!&rdquo; answered Mr.
Clark, severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met &rsquo;im in the way of business, and I&rsquo;ve
got to know &rsquo;im pretty well,&rdquo; continued Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now there&rsquo;s something he wants done,
and I thought of you for the job at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much obliged to you,&rdquo; said Mr. Clark, stiffly,
&ldquo;but I ain&rsquo;t sure that I wants to do jobs for
teetotallers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be a silly old idjit, Sam,&rdquo;
tolerantly recommended Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
want to go cutting off your nose to spite your
face&mdash;particularly with the sort of face <i>you&rsquo;ve</i>
got!&nbsp; I was only speaking figgerative,&rdquo; he hastened to
add, at Mr. Clark&rsquo;s indignant stare.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t the old &lsquo;Jane Gladys&rsquo; to be sold
soon, and won&rsquo;t you be out of a job then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking about that when you come down
&rsquo;ere,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Clark, sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; argued Mr. Dobb, &ldquo;you
want to do the best you can for yourself.&nbsp; You take on this
&rsquo;ere job I&rsquo;ve mentioned, and you&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave
a nice easy <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>life ashore for the next week or two, and all the time
you can be looking round for a proper job.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;re
far more likely to find one by being on the spot than by rushing
round frantic after you&rsquo;re paid off, ain&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I know the skipper&rsquo;ll let me go any time I want
to.&nbsp; &rsquo;E said so, only the night before last, when me
and Peter and Joe give &rsquo;im a parting present for
three-and-nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; cried Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
take on this job with the chap I&rsquo;ve brought&mdash;Poskett,
&rsquo;is name is.&nbsp; And while you&rsquo;re doing it, me and
you will keep our eyes skinned to find you a permanent job in the
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it as very kind of you, &rsquo;Orace,&rdquo;
said Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you takes it wrong,&rdquo; returned Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing it for business&mdash;strictly
for business.&nbsp; You and me and them others &rsquo;ave worked
a few good plans in the past, and I can see that my little
second-&rsquo;and shop in Fore Street gives us a chance to work a
lot more, if we was all close together.&nbsp; I mean to get you
and Peter Lock and Joe Tridge all settled &rsquo;ere near me in
Shore&rsquo;aven.&nbsp; <i>Then</i> we&rsquo;ll show
&rsquo;em!&rdquo; he prophesied, with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All four of us &rsquo;atching up ideas together
again?&nbsp; Oh, blessed wision!&nbsp; Oh, &rsquo;appy
prospect!&rdquo; murmured Mr. Clark, moved to rhapsody.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bring on your teetotallers!&rdquo; he invited.&nbsp;
&ldquo;With that before me, I&rsquo;m ready for
anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call &rsquo;im, and &rsquo;e&rsquo;ll tell
you all about it,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, and, going on deck, he
soon returned to the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle in convoy of a short,
pallid gentleman, whose very side-whiskers seemed trimmed into
semblance of stern rectitude.</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>Horace
introduced Mr. Poskett to Mr. Clark and the trio sat down at the
table.&nbsp; After Mr. Poskett had refused the offer of a cup of
cold water, considerately suggested by Mr. Clark, the object of
the visit was at once approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this, Mr. Clark,&rdquo; stated the
visitor, &ldquo;children is very difficult things to manage
properly these days, I find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thrash &rsquo;em!&rdquo; advised Mr. Clark, assuming an
air of efficiency in all matters.&nbsp; &ldquo;And not only
thrash &rsquo;em, but keep on thrashing &rsquo;em!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the only way to manage children, it seems to me, if
you wants a quiet life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what about it when the child is a girl of
twenty?&rdquo; demurred Mr. Poskett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop &rsquo;er pocket-money!&rdquo; promptly advised
Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but supposing she earns her own
pocket-money?&rdquo; propounded Mr. Poskett.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark, emitting a baffled grunt, passed to silent
examination of the problem.&nbsp; Mr. Horace Dobb, settling
himself deep in his seat, tilted back his head and puffed at his
cigar, as one who postponed intervention till the affair was more
clearly established.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you might lock up &rsquo;er bonnets,&rdquo;
hazarded Mr. Clark at last, but with no great confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she &rsquo;as to go to her employment behind the
counter at Messrs Wicklett &amp; Sharp&rsquo;s shop in the High
Street,&rdquo; objected Mr. Poskett.&nbsp; &ldquo;She comes
&rsquo;ome for dinner, and goes back again to the shop in the
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another pause, and then Mr. Clark regretfully
admitted that it seemed to him something was wrong somewhere, but
he could not quite tell where it <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>was.&nbsp; He respectfully intimated
that he might understand better were Mr. Poskett to be more
explicit in information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My niece,&rdquo; said Mr. Poskett, complying.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been and got herself engaged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut-tut!&rdquo; murmured Mr. Clark, politely
shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has!&nbsp; Without my permission!&nbsp; She never
even asked me!&rdquo; complained Mr. Poskett.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
that I should have given it, mark you, if she had asked!&nbsp;
What right has she to go and get herself engaged when she is
needed at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, what right, indeed?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clark, with
indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s &rsquo;er gratitude to me and &rsquo;er
loving aunt, who have brought &rsquo;er up since she was
eleven?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Poskett.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it not
&rsquo;er duty to tarry with us while we &rsquo;ave need of
&rsquo;er?&nbsp; We cannot spare &rsquo;er, for she is too
useful.&nbsp; I grant that she &rsquo;as done &rsquo;er fair
share of work in the past, but that ain&rsquo;t any reason why
she should seek to avoid it in the future, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; stated Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a earthly &rsquo;ome where she&rsquo;s
well looked after and kept up to the mark,&rdquo; declared Mr.
Poskett, his voice taking a high-pitched monotone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do we not know &rsquo;oo it is that lays in wait to find
work for idle &rsquo;ands?&nbsp; Work and plenty of it is the
only right way to bring up a young female.&nbsp; Idleness of body
leads to idleness of thought, my friends, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb emitted a cough with a long, droning tail to it, and
this served its purpose in restoring Mr. Poskett to more natural
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when Nancy ain&rsquo;t
at the shop, we does our best to keep &rsquo;er time properly
hemployed for &rsquo;er.&nbsp; As I say, it&rsquo;s the only
right way to bring young <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>females up, and Nancy will admit one
day, when me and my wife &rsquo;ave passed away to our reward,
that she was very well brought up indeed!&nbsp; Tidy up the
&rsquo;ouse, and off to the shop; dinner, wash-up, back to the
shop again; &rsquo;ome again, bit more tidying up, and then
bed,&rdquo; he sketched.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, ain&rsquo;t that a
model life for a young female?&nbsp; What more can a right-minded
girl want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, what, indeed?&rdquo; sighed Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is she content?&rdquo; asked Mr. Poskett, sadly.
&ldquo;Oh, dear, no!&nbsp; She knows that all flesh is grass, and
yet she talks about wanting amusements and recreation!&nbsp; And
her nearly twenty!&nbsp; And now and then she gets quite out of
control, and indulges in all manner of worldly vanities.&nbsp;
Only last week she went to a whist-drive!&nbsp; When she come
back, I wrestled with the evil spirit within &rsquo;er for a full
hour, trying to get &rsquo;er to say she repented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did she?&rdquo; queried Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did not, alas!&nbsp; She was that &rsquo;ardened
that she only said the enjoyment was worth a bit of suffering for
afterwards!&nbsp; And now she&rsquo;s gone and got &rsquo;erself
engaged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Oo to?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; complained Mr.
Poskett.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we wants to know!&nbsp;
We don&rsquo;t know &rsquo;oo &rsquo;e is, and she won&rsquo;t
tell us; and she&rsquo;s that deceitful we can&rsquo;t find
out!&nbsp; I spent &rsquo;alf an hour, only yesterday,
questioning and ex&rsquo;orting &rsquo;er, and she had not even
the grace to cry!&nbsp; If it wasn&rsquo;t for all the money
we&rsquo;ve spent in bringing &rsquo;er up, and for &rsquo;er
being so useful in the &rsquo;ome, I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave nothing
more to do with &rsquo;er!&nbsp; I believe she would like things
to come to such a sorry pass, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d not blame &rsquo;er&mdash;&rdquo; began
Mr. Clark, <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>absently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; he began again,
more carefully, &ldquo;and I shouldn&rsquo;t blame you,
neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must do my duty,&rdquo; said Mr. Poskett, unctuously.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Er place is with me and &rsquo;er aunt, and I must
keep &rsquo;er there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you ain&rsquo;t got the least idea &rsquo;oo the
young fellow is?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the least!&nbsp; She won&rsquo;t bring &rsquo;im to
the &rsquo;ome.&nbsp; She knows too much for that, because
I&rsquo;d soon send &rsquo;im about &rsquo;is business,
&rsquo;ooever &rsquo;e is!&nbsp; She won&rsquo;t even tell us
&rsquo;is name!&nbsp; All she says is that he don&rsquo;t hold
with the same views as us about anything, and that there&rsquo;d
only be trouble if we met.&nbsp; And so there would!&nbsp; And
she says she prefers things to go on as they are for a little
longer, till they&rsquo;re quite sure they really wants to marry
each other.&nbsp; She says &rsquo;is very way of earning a living
would &rsquo;orrify me, so don&rsquo;t that just show you?&nbsp;
Can you wonder I&rsquo;m &rsquo;eart-broken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was you,&rdquo; said Mr. Clark, resolutely,
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t rest till I&rsquo;d found out &rsquo;oo
&rsquo;e is!&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t be beat by a gal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, now you&rsquo;re coming to it, Sam!&rdquo; struck
in Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something of the idea
I&rsquo;ve talked over with Poskett &rsquo;ere.&nbsp; What
&rsquo;e wants is a kind of watchdog to that niece of &rsquo;is;
some one &rsquo;oo&rsquo;ll follow &rsquo;er everywhere, and find
out &rsquo;oo it is that&rsquo;s making up to &rsquo;er.&nbsp;
Then Poskett will know &rsquo;ow to act.&nbsp; But, you see,
&rsquo;im being a big man in the prayers-and-penitence line round
&rsquo;ere, it &rsquo;ud look so bad for &rsquo;im to go loafing
round the streets all day playing private detective.&nbsp; And
&rsquo;is missis is too delikit, she says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a local preacher,&rdquo; said Mr. Poskett, &ldquo;I
&rsquo;ave many hengagements, and between them and business my
time is fully occupied.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>&ldquo;In short,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Dobb,
&ldquo;&rsquo;e&rsquo;s ready to pay you to follow &rsquo;is
niece about everywhere in &rsquo;er spare time, so as you can
find out &rsquo;oo&rsquo;s the young man.&nbsp; And when you
&rsquo;ave found out&mdash;which will take you some days, I
expect, the pair of &rsquo;em being very artful to all accounts
you must go straight to Poskett and tell &rsquo;im.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s all &rsquo;e wants you to do, and &rsquo;e&rsquo;ll
pay you well for it.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to give
every minute of your time to it, otherwise &rsquo;e
wouldn&rsquo;t go to the trouble and expense of engaging some one
special for the job&mdash;would you, Poskett?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Poskett.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, what do you say, Mr. Clark?&nbsp; Will you help to
restore a girl to the proper henjoyment of &rsquo;er &rsquo;ome
life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you puts it like that,&rdquo; said Mr. Clark,
slowly, &ldquo;it don&rsquo;t sound so&mdash;&nbsp; I must say,
though, it ain&rsquo;t exactly the sort of job&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off to shake his head in a troubled, dissatisfied
way.&nbsp; In so doing, he caught a glimpse of Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s
face, and was arrested by the slight but emphatic nod which Mr.
Dobb accorded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said Mr. Clark, at once obeying the
habit of years and yielding initiative to the ex-cook.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Things progressed swiftly after that decision, and outstanding
details were settled all the sooner because Mr. Dobb had somehow
taken over control of the negotiations.&nbsp; Ten minutes later
the trio had left the &ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo; and Mr. Dobb was
returning to his emporium, while Mr. Clark was taken by Mr.
Poskett to his abode, there to be introduced to wife and niece,
so that general acquaintanceship with the family might prove a
weapon in Mr. Clark&rsquo;s hand, if necessary.</p>
<p>Reluctance was plainly discernible in Mr. Clark&rsquo;s <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>demeanour as
he entered Mr. Poskett&rsquo;s domicile, and, taken into the
front room, he glanced about him with something of guilt.&nbsp;
Relief at discovering the apartment to be void of feminine
presence was evidenced by an unconscious exclamation of pious
gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, &rsquo;ere she comes!&rdquo; announced Mr.
Poskett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit!&rdquo; begged Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
been thinking&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He clutched at his host&rsquo;s arm in some trepidation as the
door opened and an elderly female of unaffectionate aspect
entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Mr. Poskett, &ldquo;is my
wife,&rdquo; and explained the reason of Mr. Clark&rsquo;s
presence to that lady, while the seaman himself, mopping his
forehead with his handkerchief, smiled unconvincingly, and
vaguely remarked that girls would be girls, and that there was no
need to be too worried about it.</p>
<p>Before Mrs. Poskett could reply to these remarks, the latch of
the front door clicked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, &rsquo;ere&rsquo;s Nancy at last,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Poskett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and that reminds me, I&mdash;I forgot
something!&rdquo; stammered Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;Appointment I
made a week ago!&nbsp; I must be going&mdash;now&mdash;at
once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sit down!&rdquo; firmly ordered Mr. Poskett.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You &rsquo;ave set your &rsquo;and to the plough, and you
must not look back.&nbsp; Besides, &rsquo;ow could you have made
an appointment a week ago?&nbsp; You were at sea then,
weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I wrote a letter, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you could not post it at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put it in a bottle and threw it overboard,&rdquo;
gulped Mr. Clark, edging nearer the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;See you
some other time.&nbsp; I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ceased abruptly at sight of the girl who had <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>entered the
room and was now standing by the door, a little surprised at this
unusual incidence of a visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Samuel Clark, Nancy,&rdquo; said Mr.
Poskett, seizing the opportunity.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s an old friend of Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s, and one
&rsquo;oo &rsquo;as a deep knowledge of the world and its
pitfalls&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, steady!&rdquo; murmured Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;oo, I feel sure,&rdquo; continued Mr.
Poskett, with a leathery smile at the other man, &ldquo;will give
you good counsel and guidance if ever the need for such should
arise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Nancy Poskett, clearly suspecting the nature of this
tribute, bowed distantly to Mr. Clark, and sat down in a
corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ave you come straight &rsquo;ome from Wicklett
&amp; Sharp&rsquo;s, Nancy!&rdquo; asked Mrs. Poskett,
mistrustfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came back by way of East Street, aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meet anyone you know?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Poskett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One or two people,&rdquo; replied the girl,
carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;oo were they, pray?&rdquo; demanded Mrs.
Poskett, at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no one you know, aunt,&rdquo; replied Nancy, and
began to fidget with her brooch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re wearing a ring!&rdquo; shrilled her
aunt at that, and the girl quickly concealed her hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A new ring!&rdquo; went on the elder lady in awesome
tones. &ldquo;And on your engagement finger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Nancy, &ldquo;that was the finger it
was meant for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a scandalized little wait.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs.
Poskett shook their heads, muttering inchoately.&nbsp; Mr. Clark
gazed upon the mutinous damsel with but thinly veiled admiration
for her courage.&nbsp; Just as Mr. Poskett cleared his throat and
drew a deep, long breath, thereby <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>intimating that he had garnered a few
fitting phrases for immediate use, the girl rose and strolled to
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going upstairs to put on my other hat
and my coat,&rdquo; she mentioned, casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;re not going out again,
Nancy?&rdquo; quavered Mrs. Poskett, aghast.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
it&rsquo;s a quarter to eight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to run out and post a letter, aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dressing up to go and post a letter!&rdquo; groaned
Mrs. Poskett, sepulchrally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Clark will drop it in the post for you on his way
back,&rdquo; said Mr. Poskett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but it&rsquo;s rather special,&rdquo; returned
the girl; and passing out of the room, she closed the door
quietly after her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; breathed Mrs. Poskett.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a brazen hussy to deal with!&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s going out to meet <i>him</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You follow &rsquo;er the moment she leaves,&rdquo; Mr.
Poskett directed Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t let
&rsquo;er out of your sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Nancy, returning soon after, in smart outdoor toilet,
shook Mr. Clark&rsquo;s hand and bade him a quite disinterested
farewell.&nbsp; A few moments later the front door closed behind
her with a definite snap, and, a few moments later still, Mr.
Clark was in the street, intent on following her.</p>
<p>She was already some score of yards away, but none the less an
encouraging remark offered by her uncle from the doorstep to Mr.
Clark on the pavement caught her ear.&nbsp; She glanced back, and
then went on her way at slightly accelerated speed.</p>
<p>Thrice did the girl turn unexpected corners, and <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>thrice did
the portly Mr. Clark have to break into a clumsy trot before he
brought her in view again.&nbsp; And then she continued
unremittingly to the very end of a particularly long
thoroughfare, and faithfully did the panting Mr. Clark tag along
in her wake on the opposite side of the road.</p>
<p>Presently, Nancy came to a corner at the end of the
thoroughfare, and here she stopped, gazing expectantly this way
and that.&nbsp; Mr. Clark with a nimbleness surprising in one of
his build, skipped into the doorway of a shop.&nbsp; The girl,
suddenly resuming her course, passed swiftly round the corner out
of sight.&nbsp; With a feeling that the climax of the chase was
at hand, Mr. Clark darted from his lair and ambled after
her.&nbsp; Breathlessly he rounded the corner, and here he
narrowly averted collision with Miss Poskett, who was standing
quite still beneath a street lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;er&mdash;good evening, miss!&rdquo; stammered
Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&mdash;I <i>thought</i> it might be
you!&nbsp; &rsquo;Ow&mdash;&rsquo;ow do you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been following me!&rdquo; she scornfully
charged him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; he declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just a&mdash;a
cohincidence! I&mdash;I simply &rsquo;appened to be coming this
way, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy!&nbsp; And are you going along this road here on
the right, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m <i>not</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then I&rsquo;ll wish you good evening
again,&rdquo; he said, and wandered forlornly away.</p>
<p>Nancy sped off again.&nbsp; Mr. Clark, swinging round, once
more followed the trail, but with greater caution.</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>The
girl, turning and twisting among the huddled streets of the old
seaport town, gave her exhausted pursuer an engrossed
half-hour.</p>
<p>Then, again, she halted&mdash;exactly opposite her own
dwelling.&nbsp; And Mr. Clark, tottering to a full-stop, fancied
he heard a low, gleeful laugh between the ensuing opening and
shutting of the Posketts&rsquo; front door.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was a stiff and weary-eyed Mr. Clark who called to see Mr.
Horace Dobb at his shop next morning.&nbsp; Mr. Dobb, when
furnished with the narrative of the previous night&rsquo;s
events, merely smiled unsympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll
all come right in the end.&nbsp; You just keep on, to show
you&rsquo;re in earnest.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ave you arranged with
Captain Dutt to leave the &lsquo;Jane Gladys&rsquo; to-day?&nbsp;
Good!&nbsp; And got all the money owing to you?&nbsp;
Better!&nbsp; Now you must go and sit and rest yourself in the
&lsquo;Green Dragon,&rsquo; opposite Wicklett &amp; Sharp&rsquo;s
in the &rsquo;Igh Street.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be able to see when
she comes out for dinner then, and keep an eye on &rsquo;er
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faithfully did Mr. Clark obey these instructions.&nbsp; Not
only did he shadow Miss Poskett home in her dinner-hour, but he
hung about the road till she emerged again, and then watched her
back to her place of employment.&nbsp; But in the interval he was
far from happy, and his only solace was to be found in the
discovery that more than one householder spoke respectfully to
him under the impression that he was so thrilling a thing as a
detective in the local police force.</p>
<p>That same evening found him in grim ambush outside
Messrs.&nbsp; Wicklett &amp; Sharp&rsquo;s place of business, and
<a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>there he
lurked till the blinds of the shop were lowered, and at last Miss
Poskett came tripping out.&nbsp; After gazing round far more
carefully than the sentinel realized, Nancy hurried away.</p>
<p>Sedulously did Mr. Clark follow her, rejoicing that he had had
the foresight to don an easier pair of shoes this evening.&nbsp;
But to-night the course was short.&nbsp; A couple of hundred
yards were covered, and then the girl flitted into a big,
official-looking edifice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Registry Office!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t; it&rsquo;s the Free
Library!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed into the interior of the building and proceeded to
efface himself behind a newspaper-stand in a draughty, ill-lit
corner.</p>
<p>Miss Poskett, seating herself at the table nearest the fire,
selected a magazine.&nbsp; This, Mr. Clark felt sure, was but a
ruse, for every time that the swing-door opened the girl raised
her head expectantly, and then glanced up at the big clock before
returning her attention to the magazine.</p>
<p>Half an hour passed&mdash;an hour.&nbsp; Mr. Clark, prevented
from the solace of tobacco by imperative notices, found the time
dragging most tediously.&nbsp; His legs had begun to ache with
the strain of standing and he felt chilled, and savage; but he
did not dare to risk discovery by moving to more comfortable
quarters.&nbsp; Another thirty minutes crept by, and a new and
exquisite agony had come to Mr. Clark, for he was thinking now of
the many snug inns with which the town abounded, and picturing
the enjoyment of Messrs.&nbsp; Tridge and Lock in some such
paradise at that moment.</p>
<p>Another forty minutes lagged painfully past.&nbsp; The janitor
of the library began a sonorous locking-up in <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>adjacent
apartments, and still Miss Poskett remained to divide her
attention between the swing-door, the clock, and the
magazine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Closing time, please!&rdquo; pronounced the janitor,
entering.</p>
<p>Miss Poskett, springing readily to her feet, quitted the
edifice.&nbsp; Mr. Clark, one vast sensation of numb passion,
followed more slowly after her.</p>
<p>Miss Poskett, looking neither to the right nor the left,
walked briskly back to her abode; and again Mr. Clark fancied
that he heard a gurgle of malicious satisfaction as the girl
entered the Posketts&rsquo; household and closed the door after
her.</p>
<p>So furious was Mr. Clark that late as was the hour, he stamped
round to Fore Street and knocked at the door of Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s
little shop.&nbsp; The house was in darkness, but after Mr.
Clark&rsquo;s third thunderous assault on the panels, an upper
window opened and the head of Mr. Dobb, crowned with so obsolete
a thing as a nightcap, protruded in inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finished, me!&rdquo; roared Mr. Clark, to this
apparition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be a silly old stoopid!&rdquo;
counselled Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;You stick to your job like a
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it ain&rsquo;t a man&rsquo;s job!&rdquo; declared
Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sneaking about, watching gals, at my time
of life!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll trouble you to &rsquo;and in my
resignation for me to Mr. Poskett, because some&rsquo;ow I
don&rsquo;t think it &rsquo;ud be safe for me to see
&rsquo;im&mdash;safe for &rsquo;im, I mean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait a bit,&rdquo; directed Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come down to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this he did, unbolting the shop door and revealing himself
in a chaste dressing-gown of crimson flannel.&nbsp; Dragging the
fretful Mr. Clark into the back premises, he hospitably set out
glasses and a bottle, and Mr. <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>Clark&rsquo;s snarls of annoyance
died away into murmurs of faint protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said Horace, seriously,
&ldquo;you take it from me that you&rsquo;re doing very
well.&nbsp; Better than you think.&nbsp; It don&rsquo;t matter
whether you catches &rsquo;er with the chap or not; the main
point is that he knows by now that you&rsquo;re in
earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But &rsquo;ow does &rsquo;e know?&rdquo; queried Mr.
Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s told &rsquo;im!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s kept away
from &rsquo;im on purpose to diddle you, but she&rsquo;s let
&rsquo;im know by a note what&rsquo;s &rsquo;appened last night,
and you can bet she&rsquo;ll let &rsquo;im know what
&rsquo;appened to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow do <i>you</i> know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; was Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s astonishing
answer, &ldquo;because I know &rsquo;oo the fellow is!&nbsp; I
not only know &rsquo;im, but I know &rsquo;im well enough to be
very friendly with &rsquo;im, and it was &rsquo;im what told me
she&rsquo;s sent &rsquo;im word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you knows &rsquo;oo &rsquo;e is, why don&rsquo;t
you tell old Poskett and settle the affair?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Clark, very naturally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because that ain&rsquo;t in the programme,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Strictly
business!&rsquo;&rdquo; he quoted, enigmatically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Surely you ain&rsquo;t forgot that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you tell <i>me</i> &rsquo;oo
&rsquo;e is, and let me tell old Poskett?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is such a thing as digging up pertaters before
they&rsquo;re ready to be dug,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Dobb,
mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, &rsquo;ow did you find out &rsquo;oo the
chap was?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clark, with something akin to
professional jealousy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two or three days back,&rdquo; related Mr. Dobb,
&ldquo;I &rsquo;ad a very &rsquo;andsome-looking overmantel
mirror for sale &rsquo;ere.&nbsp; It was in the window, and it
caught Miss Poskett&rsquo;s <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>eye.&nbsp; And she stepped in and
admired it, and asked the price, and you could see she thought it
was a bargain.&nbsp; But she went out again, trying to be
off&rsquo;and.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, is it a riddle, or are you supposed to be telling
me something?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clark, as his friend made a long
pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d guess the rest, easy.&nbsp; First
thing next morning in comes a certain young gent, and said
&rsquo;e&rsquo;d &rsquo;eard I&rsquo;d got a overmantel for sale,
and &rsquo;e bought it straight off, almost without looking at
it.&nbsp; Ah, if only there was more lovers in the world, it
&rsquo;ud be a happier place altogether!&rdquo; stated Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;For chaps in my line of business,
anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I shall be glad when it&rsquo;s all over and
done with, that I do assure you!&rdquo; said Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I reckon I owe old Poskett something for getting me to
take on a job like this, and a grudge is a debt of honour to me,
don&rsquo;t forget!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind what you do to &rsquo;im after
it&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;In fact,
I reckon to quarrel with &rsquo;im myself before very long.&nbsp;
It won&rsquo;t matter a bit, because I &rsquo;ave pumped
&rsquo;im dry in the way of business already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish you&rsquo;d tell me&mdash;&rdquo; began
Mr. Clark, wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait!&nbsp; You see, Sam, you&rsquo;re all right,
but you ain&rsquo;t clever; and if I was to tell you &rsquo;oo
the chap is and what I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;atched out, you&rsquo;d
try to be clever and &rsquo;elp me, and that &rsquo;ud spoil
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this was an attitude from which Mr. Dobb was not to be
wooed by all the blandishments of Mr. Clark, so at last the stout
sailorman, relinquished further effort, repaired to the modest
lodging he had taken for himself in the town, and there retired
to bed.</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>So
soundly did he sleep as the result of the strain of detective
work that it was already nearly noon when he was awakened next
morning by the advent of a visitor in the form of Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was quite right,&rdquo; announced Horace.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That gal&rsquo;s sent another note to &rsquo;er young man
about the way she tricked you last night.&nbsp; Very tickled by
it, &rsquo;e was but, at the same time, &rsquo;e sees what a old
nuisance you&rsquo;re going to be to &rsquo;em when they wants to
meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;im?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;ave!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been &rsquo;aving a
long, confidential chat with &rsquo;im.&nbsp; But I ain&rsquo;t
come to talk about that now.&nbsp; I &rsquo;appen to know of a
job what might suit you&mdash;a job as ferryman down at the
&rsquo;arbour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the one job in the world I&rsquo;d really
like!&rdquo; cried Mr. Clark, enthusiastically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Rowing across the river all day from a pub. on one side to
a pub. on the other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pub. on this side is the &lsquo;Flag and
Pennant,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Horace.&nbsp; &ldquo;The landlord
there runs the ferry, and &rsquo;is ferryman is leaving
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up and ask for the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t the way to set about it&mdash;not in
this case.&nbsp; You want to use the &rsquo;ouse for a few hours
first, and then lead up to the job tactful-like.&nbsp; Tell the
landlord about your present job, and &rsquo;ow you don&rsquo;t
like it, and so on, and come to the ferry gradual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Clark, bowing to the superior wisdom of Horace, spent the
whole of the afternoon, after he had watched Miss Poskett from
her work to her home and back again, in the bar-parlour of the
&ldquo;Flag and Pennant&rdquo; and it was not till tea-time that
he decided that he had acquired sufficient standing as a patron
of the house to advance a little further in the matter of the
ferry.</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s good jobs and bad jobs, ain&rsquo;t
there, sir?&rdquo; he observed, rather irrelevantly, to the
dapper young landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish I could change my
job.&nbsp; I got a rotten job at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the landlord, without much
interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the job?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watching a young gal&mdash;a artful, tricky young
gal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watching her?&nbsp; Do you mean you are married to
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Eaven forbid!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m watching &rsquo;er
at &rsquo;er relations&rsquo; wish to find out &rsquo;oo
she&rsquo;s carrying-on with unbeknown to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought it was a very pleasant
job for a man like you,&rdquo; observed the landlord,
disdainfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Far from it!&nbsp; Little did I
think, when Poskett asked me to keep a eye on &rsquo;is
niece&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Poskett, eh?&rdquo; exclaimed the landlord, with
sudden interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;And so you are the chap who&rsquo;s
trying to find out who&rsquo;s dangling after Miss Poskett, are
you?&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He checked himself sharply.&nbsp; For a few moments he stood
tapping his fingers on the counter and eyeing Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Poskett going to do when he finds
out?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send &rsquo;im about &rsquo;is business pretty
sharp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the thing!&rdquo; exclaimed the landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; went on the other, in some
excitement, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind admitting to you that
I&rsquo;ve got more than half a mind to have a try after Miss
Poskett myself.&nbsp; I wondered why she wouldn&rsquo;t have
anything <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>to say to me until, a few days ago, I happened to see
her with the chap she fancies.&nbsp; If Poskett got rid of
him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hexactly, sir!&rdquo; concurred Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That &rsquo;ud be your chance, wouldn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>would</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell me &rsquo;oo &rsquo;e is,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; if Miss Poskett got to hear I was mixed up in
it&mdash;&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll tell you what I <i>will</i>
do!&nbsp; Here, come to the window!&nbsp; See that cottage across
the harbour&mdash;the one with the figurehead in the
garden?&nbsp; Well, he lodges there.&nbsp; His name is
Jones&mdash;William Jones.&nbsp; Here, come back!&rdquo; cried
the landlord, forcefully detaining Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand that you&rsquo;ve got to catch
&rsquo;em together first?&nbsp; Now, he hasn&rsquo;t been out
lately, because he hasn&rsquo;t been very well.&nbsp; But if you
were to watch that cottage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d catch &rsquo;im whenever &rsquo;e left, and
if I followed &rsquo;im&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s sure to be meeting
her sooner or later.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll easily recognize
him&mdash;he&rsquo;s got a big black moustache, and he&rsquo;s a
tall, thin chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose &rsquo;e left the &rsquo;ouse and
didn&rsquo;t cross the &rsquo;arbour, and I was stuck on
<i>this</i> side?&rdquo; artfully suggested Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; cried the landlord of the &ldquo;Flag
and Pennant.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed if I don&rsquo;t do you
a good turn, since you&rsquo;re going to do me one!&nbsp; You can
take over my ferry-boat.&nbsp; Then you can row backwards and
forwards all day, watching the place unsuspected.&nbsp; And if
you see him leave and not cross the harbour, you can row over as
quickly as you can and follow him.&nbsp; And if he does cross,
why, he&rsquo;s bound to come over in your ferry, and then you
can always jump out after <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>him and track him till he meets her,
and then you can fetch old Poskett along to see
&rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly sounds a proper plan,&rdquo; approved Mr.
Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;But after I&rsquo;ve fetched Poskett&mdash;do
I lose the ferry job then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the landlord, handsomely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you keep it on, on the usual terms.&nbsp;
After all, some one&rsquo;s got to do it, and it may as well be
you, especially since you&rsquo;ll have helped me a
bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Overjoyed at this facile arrangement, Mr. Clark celebrated his
new engagement so thoroughly that he quite omitted to provide
unwelcome escort for Miss Poskett that evening.&nbsp; Next
morning he entered upon his new duties, and rowed back and forth
across the estuary with ever a vigilant eye lifting towards the
cottage with the figurehead in its garden.</p>
<p>But no one answering to the description of William Jones did
he discern all day, and when at last business was over at a late
hour, he went along to see Mr. Horace Dobb and tell him all that
there was to be told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, now you&rsquo;re all right!&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb,
patronizingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;So mind you do the job satisfactory,
and keep your eyes well open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall give Poskett notice at the end of the
week,&rdquo; said Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m
hindependent of &rsquo;im, I want to get shut of &rsquo;is nasty
little job as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; pointed out Horace.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Far as I can see, the main reason why Lupcott, the
landlord of the &lsquo;Flag and Pennant,&rsquo; &rsquo;as given
you the job of ferryman is that so you can get rid of this
&rsquo;ere rival for &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot that,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Never mind, <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>I&rsquo;ll soon nab the pair of &rsquo;em now, and then
I can turn over a new leaf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, indeed, Mr. Clark had not succeeded in catching even a
glimpse of Mr. William Jones by the next day, nor the next, nor
the next after that.&nbsp; Confessing his failure rather
apprehensively to his patron, Mr. Lupcott, he was relieved when
that gentleman, bidding him cheer up, cited the precedent of
Bruce&rsquo;s spider.</p>
<p>A few more days passed.&nbsp; Mr. Clark, now well established
in his new sphere of activity, was winning custom and popularity
by the nice distinction of his manners and the careful choice of
his vocabulary, and was almost forgetting the very existence of
the secretive Mr. Jones, when one morning the affair of Miss
Poskett&rsquo;s love passage suddenly loomed large again before
him.</p>
<p>It so chanced that Mr. Clark had just started from the further
side of the river, when loud shouts for his immediate presence
claimed his attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bit of a &rsquo;urry, seemingly,&rdquo; commented Mr.
Clark, and obligingly began to row back.</p>
<p>There were two male figures awaiting him.&nbsp; One of them
was brandishing his arms and bellowing; the other, taking matters
more calmly, leaned in repose against a post, smiling at his
companion&rsquo;s vehemence.&nbsp; The excitable gentleman was
Mr. Poskett, the other was Mr. Horace Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice thing!&nbsp; A nice thing!&rdquo; raved Mr.
Poskett, as the nose of the ferry-boat grounded and Mr. Clark
stepped ashore.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fraud!&nbsp; A
impostor!&nbsp; A broken reed!&nbsp; A foolish virgin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bewildered Mr. Clark, gazing from this figure of wrath to
the placid mien of Mr. Dobb, received a slow, significant wink
from that gentleman.</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been betrayed!&rdquo; shrilly
declaimed Mr. Poskett.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wounded in my
tenderest feelings!&nbsp; While you&rsquo;ve been
pretendin&rsquo; to be so watchful and alert, my niece &rsquo;as
slipped away and got married!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s just sent me a
telegram, telling me about it, and &rsquo;ow she was starting off
on &rsquo;er &rsquo;oneymoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;As she&mdash;&rsquo;as she married &rsquo;im,
after all?&rdquo; queried Mr. Clark, in a surprised tone that was
not entirely devoid of approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She &rsquo;as!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s been meetin&rsquo;
&rsquo;im regular the last few days, it seems,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married that &rsquo;ere Jones, and I never so much as
set eyes on &rsquo;im!&rdquo; marvelled Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s artfulness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Poskett, gasping for words, shook his head helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Mr. Lupcott, of the &lsquo;Flag and
Pennant,&rsquo; she married, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb,
softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, &rsquo;e told me this morning that &rsquo;e was
going away for a few days, and &rsquo;e clapped me on the
shoulder and laughed, and I wondered why!&rdquo; cried Mr.
Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;But&mdash;but that &rsquo;ere
Jones&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There never was any Jones, Sam,&rdquo; explained Mr.
Dobb, in gentle accents.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lupcott invented &rsquo;im
simply to keep you fixed in one spot, so &rsquo;e could go on
meeting Miss Poskett.&nbsp; Matter of fact, I invented &rsquo;im
for Lupcott!&nbsp; It was Lupcott &rsquo;oo was after &rsquo;er
all along, as I knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb nodded significantly towards Mr. Poskett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere!&rdquo; readily cried Mr. Clark,
advancing on that gentleman threateningly.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
&rsquo;ere slipway is private property, and I&rsquo;m in charge
of it.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>want you &rsquo;anging about
&rsquo;ere listening to gentlemen&rsquo;s conversation!&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t like the looks of you, me man.&nbsp; I never did, and
I never shall, so clear out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ear, &rsquo;ear!&rdquo; murmured Horace,
shamelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got anything to say to me,&rdquo;
warned Mr. Clark, &ldquo;I advise you not to say it!&nbsp;
Get!&nbsp; See?&nbsp; Get!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Poskett, noting the terrible earnestness of Mr.
Clark&rsquo;s visage, glanced wildly about him, and discovered
how remote the slipway was from civilization.&nbsp; Yielding
suddenly to panic, he turned and trotted away, followed by the
heartless laughter of Mr. Dobb and certain blood-curdling threats
from Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s settled &rsquo;im!&rdquo; stated Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E ain&rsquo;t the sort to trouble you
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a good job too!&rdquo; declared Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first really comfortable minute I&rsquo;ve
spent since first I took &rsquo;is little job on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Sam, it served its purpose,&rdquo; said Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Soon as ever &rsquo;e spoke to me about
&rsquo;is niece, and as soon as ever I knew that Lupcott was in
it, I began to look round for a chance.&nbsp; And when I learned
Lupcott&rsquo;s ferryman was leaving &rsquo;im, I saw the chance
sticking out as plain as plain.&nbsp; Luckily I was friendly with
all parties.&nbsp; It was me what put Lupcott up to the plan of
giving you the ferry to look after to keep you from interfering;
it was me what suggested you to Poskett for the job of watching
&rsquo;is niece; and it was me, Sam, what advised Lupcott not to
let you know &rsquo;ow things really stood, in case you might
want to be too &rsquo;elpful.&nbsp; And I know what you are when
you tries to be clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m very much obliged to
you,&rdquo; murmured Mr. Clark.</p>
<p><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>&ldquo;Put two and two neatly together, &rsquo;ave you,
and found out &rsquo;oo the answer is?&rdquo; bantered Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I a wonder?&nbsp; All that
&rsquo;ead work done by me, and you only &rsquo;ad to stand by
and wait&mdash;and you didn&rsquo;t even know you was standing by
and waiting.&nbsp; So now, if you likes, you can take me into the
&lsquo;Flag and Pennant&rsquo; and stand me something to drink
success to your new career.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; said Mr. Clark, counting his
available wealth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get in the boat, and let me take
you across the river and back again.&nbsp; The fare&rsquo;ll be
tuppence.&nbsp; And then we can both &rsquo;ave a
drink!&rdquo;</p>

53</span><i>EPISODE III</i><br />
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE</h2>
<p>Superlative virtues of construction and design, never before
suspected, were boldly claimed for the &ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo;
in the auctioneer&rsquo;s announcement which advertised her
imminent sale.&nbsp; So respect-compelling was the list of good
qualities now stated to be embodied in the unlovely hulk of that
ancient vessel that even the two members of her crew who lingered
on in residence as caretakers felt that their social standing was
enhanced by association with such a superior craft.&nbsp; In
order to demonstrate their new-found dignity, they left
unperformed as much menial work as possible, preferring to sun
themselves on deck in more fitting and gentlemanly leisure.</p>
<p>Thus it was that Mr. Joseph Tridge was idly leaning against
the side one morning, surveying the horizon with a certain bored
restfulness, and Mr. Peter Lock was reclining on deck in triple
enjoyment of pipe and newspaper and slippered ease, when a voice
hailed the &ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo; from a small boat further
out in the river.</p>
<p>In the boat was the venerable Mr. Samuel Clark, formerly the
doyen of the &ldquo;Jane Gladys&rsquo;&rdquo; crew, and now, by
the grace of Fate and the artifice of man, the motive-power of
the little ferry which plied across Shorehaven Harbour at its
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, &rsquo;ullo, Sam!&rdquo; greeted Mr. Tridge,
waking to extreme cordiality.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just the chap I was
&rsquo;oping to see!&nbsp; Tie up and come aboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>&ldquo;Not me!&rdquo; replied Mr. Clark, very
definitely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just for a chat?&rdquo; wheedled Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit dull for us &rsquo;ere, you know,
Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to risk it,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;I only give you a friendly shout as I was
passing, like.&nbsp; You ain&rsquo;t going to cut my &rsquo;air
again to-day, Joe, so you might just as well understand that at
once.&nbsp; You cut it yesterday, and you cut it last Thursday,
and you cut it last Toosday.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean to be
unfriendly or un&rsquo;elpful, Joe, but you&rsquo;ve got to give
it a rest to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must practice on something!&rdquo; protested
Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practice on Peter Lock, then,&rdquo; recommended Mr.
Clark.</p>
<p>Mr. Lock rose and looked over the side.&nbsp; Mr. Lock&rsquo;s
hair, oiled and combed to a miracle of sleekness, glistened in
the sun; Mr. Lock&rsquo;s chin and cheeks, bizarrely ornamented
with strips of sticking-plaster, presented an object-lesson in
first aid to the injured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve struck!&rdquo; announced Mr. Lock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to humour him no more.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve let &rsquo;im practise shaving on me till me face
looks as if some one had been playing noughts-and-crosses on it
in red ink, and I&rsquo;ve let him shampoo and brilliantine my
hair till I can&rsquo;t hardly read for the smell of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Orace told me to put in all the practice I
could,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge, stoutly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
I&rsquo;m going to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what for?&rdquo; queried Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What for?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I wants to
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; admitted Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Orace &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t told me yet.&nbsp; All
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s told me to do is to train meself for
&rsquo;air-dressing, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing.&nbsp;
What &rsquo;Orace says is good enough for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Clark nodded approval of such simple loyalty.&nbsp; <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>He mentioned
that even when Horace had been cook to the &ldquo;Jane
Gladys&rdquo; he was always averse from premature revelation of
the workings of his mind; and went on to say that now Horace was
no longer Horace the cook, but had blossomed out into Mr. Horace
Dobb, second-hand dealer, carrying on business in a little shop
in Fore Street, Shorehaven, he cultivated an even greater
reticence in matters of diplomacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Learn a bit of &rsquo;air-dressing,&rsquo; says
&rsquo;Orace to me,&rdquo; narrated Mr. Tridge, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m learning a bit of &rsquo;air-dressing according.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Orace &rsquo;as got something in &rsquo;is mind, you can
depend on that.&nbsp; And I take it a bit uncharitable of you,
Sam, not to &rsquo;elp me and &rsquo;Orace.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ow can I
practise &rsquo;air-dressing if I don&rsquo;t get no &rsquo;air
to dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practise on the ship&rsquo;s mop,&rdquo; put forward
Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done that,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge, with
scorn for so obvious a suggestion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
propped that up and give it a &rsquo;air-cut over and over again,
till it&rsquo;s only a bare stump now.&nbsp; Yes, and I&rsquo;ve
clean-shaved the ship&rsquo;s scrubbing-brush, too, to see how
I&rsquo;d get on with a really stiff beard.&nbsp; But you must
&rsquo;ave living models to do any good.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ow else can
you tell if you&rsquo;re &rsquo;urting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; yielded Mr. Clark, &ldquo;just to keep
your &rsquo;and in, I&rsquo;ll let you shave the back of my neck
if you like, only don&rsquo;t forget that the back of me neck
don&rsquo;t leave off level with the top of my ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fastened his boat and went aboard his old home.&nbsp;
Seating himself resignedly on a packing-case, he submitted to the
ministrations of Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; So that Mr. Horace Dobb,
appearing presently on the gang-plank, expressed commendation of
the assiduity with which Mr. Tridge was seeking to acquire
tonsorial skill.</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>&ldquo;All the same, &rsquo;Orace,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
Tridge, &ldquo;I should like to know what the idea is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only another day or two, Joe,&rdquo; promised Mr. Dobb,
&ldquo;and then, if things pan out right, you&rsquo;ll be cutting
&rsquo;air in a little shop practically your own.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ow&rsquo;s that, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I take it as very kind of you,
&rsquo;Orace,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge, with gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you takes it wrong,&rdquo; retorted Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know my motter, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we all knows it,&rdquo; put in Mr. Lock, a little
hostilely.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s &lsquo;Strictly
Business!&rsquo;&nbsp; Saved you a pint or two in its time,
hasn&rsquo;t it, that motter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It &rsquo;as,&rdquo; confirmed Mr. Dobb, by no means
abashed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a jolly good motter, far as I&rsquo;m
concerned.&nbsp; And this &rsquo;air-dressing idea is strictly
business.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m working it for all our sakes, and mine
most of all.&nbsp; When I&rsquo;ve got Joe settled as a barber
and found something for you, Peter, the four of us ought to work
some good deals together, from my little place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ferryman, a barber, a&mdash;a something else, and a
second-hand dealer,&rdquo; catalogued Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
ain&rsquo;t a bad web to spread.&nbsp; Lots of rubbish gets sold
because of rumours about them being vallyble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exackly!&rdquo; concurred Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
barbers&rsquo; shops and ferry-boats is the place for
gossip.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s lots of strangers visits
Shore&rsquo;aven during the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you&rsquo;re going to start me in a
barber&rsquo;s shop!&rdquo; remarked Mr. Tridge, with great
satisfaction.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will there be a cash-register?&rdquo;
he asked, as an interesting after-thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>I</i> ain&rsquo;t going to start you,
Joe,&rdquo; corrected Mr. <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Mrs.
Jackson what&rsquo;s going to start you, only she don&rsquo;t
know it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A widow!&rdquo; divined Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A old widow, and a bit of a pal of my
missis&rsquo;s,&rdquo; supplemented Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I guessed there was a catch somewhere!&rdquo;
sourly stated Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I ain&rsquo;t going
to get married, see?&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t at all the marrying
sort.&nbsp; I prefers to remain single, thank you.&nbsp; Besides
which, I&rsquo;ve got one somewhere, already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Joe,&rdquo; returned Mr. Dobb,
soothingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I expect she&rsquo;d turn up &rsquo;er
eyes at you in &rsquo;oly &rsquo;orror in any case.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s a pillar of temp&rsquo;rance, Joe, and a anti-smoker
and a anti-gambler, and all the rest of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder she&rsquo;s a widow!&rdquo; softly commented
Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, anyway,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge, churlishly,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want no business dealings with a woman like
<i>that</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see &rsquo;er often, Joe,&rdquo;
returned Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;She only comes into
Shore&rsquo;aven once a month or so, just to collect the rents of
a few cottages she&rsquo;s got.&nbsp; Comes in for the day, she
does, settles &rsquo;er business, gets a cheap tea along of my
missis, and back she goes &rsquo;ome, a good three miles
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where do I come in?&rdquo; asked Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You comes in at one hundred and twenty-one, &rsquo;Igh
Street,&rdquo; replied Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;That belongs to
&rsquo;er.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a little, tiny, squeezed-in shop what
she owns.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a barber&rsquo;s shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m to be the hassistant,&rdquo;
surmised Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hassistant?&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s so small that if
there was <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>to be a hassistant there&rsquo;d be no room left for a
customer!&nbsp; No, Joe; you&rsquo;re to run the &rsquo;ole
show.&nbsp; The chap what&rsquo;s there now is leaving soon, you
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, anticipating the further curiosity of Mr. Tridge,
went on to explain that the present tenant was in occupation of
the premises on profit-sharing terms with the landlady.&nbsp; The
stock and fixtures had recently come into Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s
possession in the course of business, subsequent to the temporary
employment of a broker&rsquo;s man.</p>
<p>And now Mrs. Jackson, loth to lose her interest in the
barbering profession, designed to procure yet another hairdresser
to fill the place, on the same terms of partnership, of the
dispossessed tenant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t
supposed to know much about it.&nbsp; I only know what
she&rsquo;s told my missis in gossip, and I must say my missis is
a good &rsquo;un at asking a few simple questions over a cup of
tea without appearing nosey over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and what do I do now?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go up and ask &rsquo;er for the
job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, no!&rdquo; was Horace&rsquo;s baffling
response.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s filled it already, far as
she&rsquo;s concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the back of my neck, Joe, when
you&rsquo;ve finished cutting rashers out of it,&rdquo; came Mr.
Clark&rsquo;s mild reminder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;Orace shouldn&rsquo;t go giving me shocks
like that!&rdquo; indignantly exclaimed Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere &rsquo;ave I been spending a &rsquo;ole week
learning &rsquo;air-dressing in all its branches, and now, just
when I&rsquo;m perfect, &rsquo;e breaks the noos to me in a
roundabout way that I&rsquo;ve wasted my time for
nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said as far as <i>she</i> was concerned, Joe,&rdquo;
remarked Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not as far as <i>I</i> was
concerned.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>a very different matter.&nbsp; You
just carry on and wait a day or two.&nbsp; And you, Sam Clark,
you tell your boss that you&rsquo;re rather hexpecting to
&rsquo;ave another attack of colic soon, and stand by to take
horders from me at any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Refusing to shed further enlightenment at this juncture, Mr.
Dobb turned and left the &ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo; with rather a
consciously Napoleonic stride.</p>
<p>For the rest of that day Mr. Tridge and Mr. Lock found
engrossing employment in devising theories as to the exact nature
of Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s machinations.&nbsp; Mr. Lock was of opinion
that Mr. Tridge would be called on to impersonate Mrs.
Jackson&rsquo;s new partner in the hairdressing business, though
he admitted that he could not imagine how this was to be carried
through to complete success.&nbsp; On the other hand, Mr. Tridge,
displaying a truculent species of pessimism, obstinately inclined
to the belief that yet a parson and a wedding-ring would be found
to be lurking at the back of Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s strategy.</p>
<p>And Mr. Samuel Clark, ever somewhat crude and confused in his
ideas, plied his ferry all that afternoon, oblivious of his
surroundings even to the point of returning thanks for a tip of a
French halfpenny.&nbsp; The only thing his mind could dwell on
was that, at some near date, the widowed Mrs. Jackson was to be
lured by Horace into a hairdressing saloon and there relieved, by
some pretext, of the money she had been collecting in
rents.&nbsp; The morality of such a proceeding did not trouble
the plump sailorman; he found sufficient extenuation in the
thought that it was the job of the police to prevent such
things.</p>
<p>But late that same evening, at the &ldquo;Jolly
Sailors,&rdquo; Mr. Dobb exhibited himself in a more
communicative <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>mood.&nbsp; Assembling his former shipmates around him,
he extended a strictly rationed hospitality towards them, and
then, of his own free-will, reverted to the twin subjects of the
hairdressing business and Mrs. Jackson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old gal came in to tea quite unexpected
to-day,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s three times in
a little over a fortnight.&nbsp; &rsquo;Owever, I sold &rsquo;er
a second-&rsquo;and dish-cover, so she&rsquo;s paid for more than
she&rsquo;s ate up to now.&nbsp; She sat a long time over
&rsquo;er tea chatting to my missis.&nbsp; Of course it
didn&rsquo;t hinterest me, so I went out into the shop.&nbsp;
Only I couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;elp &rsquo;earing a lot, because
some-&rsquo;ow I&rsquo;d left the door open, and it would
&rsquo;ave looked so rude to &rsquo;ave closed it deliberate
between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned back and, with a smile of profound
self-satisfaction, eyed each of his friends in turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; prompted Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new chap she&rsquo;s got &rsquo;er eye on is
arriving the day after to-morrow to see the place and fix up
finally with &rsquo;er.&nbsp; Oh, she&rsquo;s very took with
&rsquo;im!&nbsp; She ain&rsquo;t ever seen &rsquo;im yet, but
&rsquo;is letters &rsquo;ave touched &rsquo;er &rsquo;eart
proper.&nbsp; It seems &rsquo;e&rsquo;s just the very sort of
chap she&rsquo;s been advertising for&mdash;a lifelong
teetotaller, a nonsmoker, never bets nor swears, always punctual,
steady, and methodical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short,&rdquo; restively summarized Mr. Tridge,
&ldquo;just the sort of chap I <i>ain&rsquo;t</i>!&nbsp; Seems to
me I stands a fine chance against &rsquo;im with a silly old
geezer like &rsquo;er!&rdquo; he added, ungallantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Owever, go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s coming down from London by the
hexpress.&nbsp; Well, now, supposing &rsquo;e didn&rsquo;t
harrive, or something went wrong and they failed to come to a
hagreement?&nbsp; Why, the shop would be standing empty from next
Saturday, and she&rsquo;d be at &rsquo;er wits&rsquo; ends to
find some one else!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s spent pounds in
hadvertising for a <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>teetotal, non-smoking barber as it is.&nbsp; Well, up
you goes to see &rsquo;er, Joe Tridge, gives <i>me</i> as a
reference, and gets the job temporary.&nbsp; And once
you&rsquo;re in, you ain&rsquo;t the man you used to be if
anything short of dynamite gets you out of that job
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why couldn&rsquo;t you &rsquo;ave recommended me to
start with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know in time.&nbsp; And, for another
thing, she was so set on getting a pattern of virtue.&nbsp; But
when she finds things &rsquo;ave gone wrong, and there&rsquo;s no
time to spare, unless she&rsquo;s willing to lose money by it,
she won&rsquo;t be so partic&rsquo;lar, and she&rsquo;ll overlook
some of your faults, Joe, if you keeps the rest of &rsquo;em
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem pretty sure things are going wrong,&rdquo;
said Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can feel it in me bones,&rdquo; returned Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anyway Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s coming in the day
after to-morrow to meet this chap at one hundred and twenty-one,
&rsquo;Igh Street.&nbsp; Now, I <i>may</i> be at the station when
&rsquo;e arrives, and pass the time of day with
&rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can &rsquo;ear the dawn breaking,&rdquo; observed Mr.
Tridge, humorously.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;im
there&rsquo;s nothing doing, and say you were sent by &rsquo;er
to meet &rsquo;im and tell &rsquo;im so.&nbsp; And she&rsquo;ll
think &rsquo;e never come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helementary, Joe,&rdquo; criticized Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Most helementary!&nbsp; &rsquo;E&rsquo;d write to
&rsquo;er when &rsquo;e got back, and then the fat &rsquo;ud be
out of the frying-pan and into the fire.&nbsp; No, I mean to fix
it so that she&rsquo;s finished with &rsquo;im for good and all
two minutes after she&rsquo;s first set eyes on
&rsquo;im!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;ow do you do that?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mesmerism?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, circumstantial hevidence,&rdquo; returned Mr. Dobb,
<a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>happily.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more people comes a
cropper over circumstantial hevidence than over the truth coming
out by haccident, and that&rsquo;s saying a lot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced warily about him, and then raised his arms in a
gesture inviting closer heed to his words.&nbsp; Four heads bent
over the table; three pairs of ears listened attentively.&nbsp;
From one pair of lips came a whispered fluency of instruction and
explanation.&nbsp; Finally, Mr. Dobb sat back with simpering
pride, and his three companions unanimously expressed their awed
respect for his brain-powers.</p>
<p>Again Mr. Dobb bent forward to add sundry details, promising
to instruct those selected for dramatic roles at a more private
opportunity on the morrow.</p>
<p>Mr. Samuel Clark, flattered by having the star part assigned
to him, promised that he would rehearse on every possible
occasion during the following day.&nbsp; Some twenty-two hours
later Mr. Dobb called at Mr. Clark&rsquo;s lodgings to see
whether he was fulfilling this promise, and Mr. Clark at once
afforded him something in the nature of a dress rehearsal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Puffect!&rdquo; declared Horace, with enthusiasm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A born actor couldn&rsquo;t do it better, especially when
you rolls your eyes up like that.&nbsp; I see it was blowing a
bit fresh when I come along just now, so there&rsquo;ll be a nice
little ground-swell off the &rsquo;arbour-mouth to-morrow.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ave you arranged to &rsquo;ave colic to-morrow, like I
told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All fixed up; and I&rsquo;ve got some one else to look
after the ferry for the day, and I&rsquo;ve borrowed a small
boat, like what you said.&nbsp; And I shall be waiting where you
told me all the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea!&rdquo; approved Horace.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And now we&rsquo;ll just go and see if Peter Lock
remembers all he&rsquo;s <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>got to say, and then we&rsquo;ll see
if the clock in the &lsquo;Jolly Sailors&rsquo; keeps good
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Horace Dobb was patrolling the platform of Shorehaven
railway-station next morning when the express from London came to
a standstill there.</p>
<p>Of the few passengers that thankfully alighted, the majority
were sailormen.&nbsp; Several women and children made up a goodly
share of the rest of the number.&nbsp; Of the half-dozen residue,
five were gentlemen known to Mr. Dobb by sight or
personally.&nbsp; The sixth was a complete stranger, and Mr.
Dobb, with a pious expression of gratitude for this
simplification of his task of identifying Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s
expected visitor, at once approached him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going straight back to the Town &rsquo;All, Mr.
Binson?&rdquo; asked Horace, innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re making an error,&rdquo;
was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;My name is not Binson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mean to tell me you&rsquo;re not Mr. Binson, our
town-clerk of Shore&rsquo;aven &rsquo;ere?&rdquo; demanded Mr.
Dobb, incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not.&nbsp; I am a complete stranger to this
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; marvelled Mr. Dobb, &ldquo;you are
the exact image of Mr. Binson, that&rsquo;s all I can
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; returned the other, with scant interest
in the coincidence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, as I say, I am a perfect
stranger here.&nbsp; I should be glad, in fact, if you would tell
me the nearest way to the High Street.&nbsp; I have a business
appointment there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, with equal listlessness.
&ldquo;Which end of &rsquo;Igh Street?&nbsp; It makes a
difference &rsquo;ow you goes from &rsquo;ere, according to which
end you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>&ldquo;Number one hundred and twenty-one.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a barber&rsquo;s shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Name of
Bonner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At present, yes,&rdquo; conceded the other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It really belongs to a lady, though&mdash;to Mrs.
Jackson.&nbsp; Perhaps you know her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Eard of &rsquo;er, I fancy,&rdquo; returned Mr.
Dobb, cursorily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pity you got out at this station,
though.&nbsp; Your nearest would &rsquo;ave been the station the
other side of the river.&nbsp; &rsquo;Owever, you come along of
me, and I&rsquo;ll see you on the right road.&nbsp; Shall we just
&rsquo;ave one gargle before we start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gargle?&rdquo; asked the other one, in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonic,&rdquo; elucidated Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, no,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
a lifelong abstainer from all alcoholic drinks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you like,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, readily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, come along with me, and I&rsquo;ll take you down to
the ferry and get you taken across the river, and you&rsquo;ll
soon be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there was another station.&nbsp; I
suppose the ferry <i>is</i> the shortest way?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
a good sailor, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s eyes glinted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll be all right!&rdquo; he declared, and
led the other man by devious paths away from the neighbourhood of
the High Street and down to the harbour.&nbsp; To avoid questions
which might be thorny to answer, Mr. Dobb walked swiftly and a
little in advance of his companion, who, evidently deeming Mr.
Dobb something of a roisterous blade, seemed relieved by this
arrangement.&nbsp; Arrived at the quay, Mr. Dobb perceived the
lounging form of Mr. Samuel Clark, and led the stranger up to
him.</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>&ldquo;This gent wants you to row &rsquo;im over to near
the &rsquo;Igh Street, ferryman,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, and be as quick over it as you can,&rdquo; he added,
holding Mr. Clark&rsquo;s gaze; &ldquo;because &rsquo;e says
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s not a very good sailor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be as quick as I can,&rdquo; promised Mr.
Clark; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a pretty strong tide running,
sir, don&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no risk I suppose?&rdquo; asked the
visitor, smiling a little anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, no, sir,&rdquo; declared Mr. Clark, cosily.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be as safe as &rsquo;ouses with
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a courteous exchange of compliments, Mr. Dobb parted from
his new acquaintance.&nbsp; A minute later Mr. Clark had begun to
convey his passenger across the river, and Mr. Dobb was returning
homeward with the mien of one whose morning has been well
spent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The current seems quite strong,&rdquo; remarked the
gentleman from London.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It are,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Clark, straining at his
sculls. &ldquo;The current&rsquo;s always pretty strong
&rsquo;ere when the tide&rsquo;s running out.&nbsp; Like a
mill-stream sometimes, and the worst of it is that you
don&rsquo;t know it till you get well out on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we&rsquo;ll land at the nearest point
opposite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll <i>try</i> to land there,&rdquo; amended
Mr. Clark, gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Matter of fact, the tide&rsquo;s
stronger to-day than I&rsquo;ve ever known it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We seem to be drifting further and further down the
river,&rdquo; observed the other, now clearly falling prey to
nerves.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think it would be better to turn
round and go back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn round, sir&mdash;with the tide running
<i>out</i>?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clark, in accents almost
scandalized.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>we should be capsized for dead,
certain sure, in less than no time.&nbsp; Begging your pardon,
sir, but it&rsquo;s plain you&rsquo;re no sailor, to talk like
that.&nbsp; No, we can&rsquo;t turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps if you were to&mdash;to keep
the&mdash;the front of the boat pointed straighter for the bank
opposite&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; stated Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The tide&rsquo;s too strong.&nbsp; We must land as near as
we can, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; I never knoo such a tide!&rdquo;
he ended, pettishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any
chance of being carried out beyond that lighthouse there at the
very end, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;ope and pray not!&rdquo; soberly returned Mr.
Clark.</p>
<p>He bent to his sculls with the greatest determination.&nbsp; A
more sophisticated passenger might have noticed that the ferryman
was pulling far harder with one arm than the other.&nbsp; The
present fare, however, was engrossed in observing more and more
of the opposite bank slip by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe we shall be carried right out to
sea!&rdquo; he said at last, with the utmost concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if <i>I</i> can &rsquo;elp it!&rdquo; denied Mr.
Clark, and gave a straining, spectacular display of
oarsmanship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>shall</i> be carried out to sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Clark, shipping his skulls with commendable neatness,
stared owlishly at the passenger for a few moments, and then
ejaculated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh!&nbsp; Ooh, ah!&rdquo; with intensity of
feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&nbsp; Whatever is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh!&nbsp; Ooh, ah!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my &rsquo;eart!&rdquo; he explained, hollowly,
and made a fearsome rolling of his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
strained it, or busted it, or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>&ldquo;But&mdash;but we shall be
capsized&mdash;drowned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t row another stroke just now, not to
save my life,&rdquo; groaned Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you
mustn&rsquo;t try to take the oars, not even if you know
&rsquo;ow to manage &rsquo;em.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d upset the boat
if you tried to change places with me, and you&rsquo;d upset it
if you tried to row from where you&rsquo;re sitting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His passenger, abandoning a half-formed intention, sat very
still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we shout to the people ashore?&rdquo; he
asked, dismally, as the little boat swept on past the harbour
lighthouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ear you,&rdquo; moaned Mr.
Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could wave to them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And upset the boat?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clark, faintly.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very, very easy upset.&nbsp; The chap what
owns this boat never tells &rsquo;er &rsquo;istory when
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s &rsquo;iring it out to visitors in the
summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we <i>do</i>?&nbsp; What <i>can</i> we
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do?&nbsp; Why, nothing, except &rsquo;ope.&nbsp; We
must just let the old boat float out and trust to
luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; protested the other,
wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh!&nbsp; Ooh, ah!&rdquo; bellowed Mr. Clark, in
accents of acute anguish, as the easiest way to foreclose vain
conversation.</p>
<p>He sat back, groaning horribly, and rubbing various portions
of his anatomy, a fearful glare in his eyes.</p>
<p>The other man, watching him miserably, took a firm grasp of
the seat as the little craft began to pitch and dance over the
turmoil of the harbour-bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&mdash;we&mdash;&rdquo; murmured Mr. Clark,
with difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We what?&rdquo; asked the other, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said Mr. Clark, blankly.</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>There
was dire silence.&nbsp; The little boat drifted further and
further out, till it was clear of the harbour, and here the scour
of the tide carried it well away from the roadstead.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark, opening one eye, shrewdly surveyed the
locality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just&mdash;just remembered,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a anchor &rsquo;ere in the locker&mdash;a
anchor and any amount of cable.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll chuck it over,
and we&rsquo;ll ride &rsquo;ere, as easy as easy, till the tide
turns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel strong enough to row us back
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ave a &rsquo;eart, sir!&rdquo; begged Mr. Clark,
reproachfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;It &rsquo;ud pull my arms out of
their sockets to row against this current.&nbsp; But we&rsquo;ll
be all right &rsquo;ere.&nbsp; Once I get the anchor overboard,
like this, we&rsquo;ll be as safe as safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All very well!&rdquo; fulminated the passenger,
recovering a little spirit when he noted that the anchor had
checked further seaward flow.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh!&nbsp; Ooh, ah!&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For &rsquo;eaven&rsquo;s sake, sir, don&rsquo;t go
a-hagitating of me.&nbsp; When I &rsquo;ave attacks like this,
I&rsquo;m sometimes liable to fits, and if I &rsquo;ave a fit
&rsquo;ere, over goes the boat, and it&rsquo;s all up with both
of us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear&mdash;oh, dear!&rdquo; wailed the other,
subsiding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to lie down in the bottom of
the boat,&rdquo; announced Mr. Clark, wanly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if
I smokes a pipe that might do me good, by composing of my
nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kindled his pipe, and forthwith settled himself very
comfortably in the bottom of the boat.&nbsp; For headrest, he had
a pillow he fortunately happened to have brought with him.&nbsp;
By a similar kindness of chance, he had also provided himself
with a thick overcoat, and with this he now snugly covered
himself.</p>
<p>Ensued a bleak period of human silence, accentuated <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>by the
lapping of the water round the boat, and the phantom-like scream
of wheeling sea-birds.&nbsp; The passenger, sitting humped-up in
an attitude of complete dejection, surveyed the prone Mr. Clark
and subconsciously became aware of the gentle, rhythmic fall and
rise of the anchored craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, it&rsquo;s most unfortunate!&rdquo; he whined,
at last. &ldquo;Most unfor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly; his expression was a blend of alarm and
self-suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I
do hope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Clark, stirring, opened one eye sufficiently to see that
the complexion of his companion had passed to a strange
olive-green shade, and that he was holding his palm to his
forehead.&nbsp; Mr. Clark closed his eye again with a warm glow
of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, Mr. Clark again glanced at his
companion.&nbsp; That gentleman&rsquo;s complexion was now some
shades lighter, though still green of hue, and he was sitting
with his arms hanging limply by his side.&nbsp; His expression
suggested that he had no further interest in life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow are you gettin&rsquo; on?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Clark.</p>
<p>The other man, turning a pair of glassy eyes on him, shook his
head dolefully and groaned.&nbsp; Mr. Clark, settling down again
in comfort, was callous enough to smile.</p>
<p>Another half-hour elapsed, with the stout ferryman taking life
easily at the bottom of the boat, and with the passenger gaining
inside information as to the treacherous nature of a small boat
when anchored in deep waters.&nbsp; Then, for the third time, Mr.
Clark appraised the state of his passenger and decided that the
time for convalescence had come.</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>Heartily remarking that the rest had done him a world of
good, he resumed his seat and began to scull towards the harbour
with the greatest of ease.&nbsp; His passenger, drooping woefully
in his place, evidenced no emotion whatever at this impending
termination to his troubles.</p>
<p>In excellent style Mr. Clark regained the sanctuary of the
harbour and drew near to the quay.&nbsp; Mr. Peter Lock, an alert
sentinel there for some while past, was waiting to greet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, poor fellow!&rdquo; sympathized Mr. Lock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He <i>do</i> look ill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t trouble to feel sorry for &rsquo;im,
Peter,&rdquo; said Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s in
that state &rsquo;e don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s
&rsquo;appening, or whether it&rsquo;s &rsquo;appening to
&rsquo;im or somebody else.&nbsp; Got a bit of a &rsquo;eadache,
ain&rsquo;t you, sir?&rdquo; he bawled at the passenger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; groaned the sufferer, making feeble gestures
with his hands and showing the yellows of his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he moaned again, and would have collapsed
had not Mr. Clark passed a supportive arm round him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are, Peter.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
said Mr. Clark, with something of a showman&rsquo;s pride.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Give me a hand to get &rsquo;im out of the boat and up on
to the quay.&nbsp; All O.K., I s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo; he added,
enigmatically.</p>
<p>Mr. Lock nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to &rsquo;ave tea with
&rsquo;Orace&rsquo;s missis, and she&rsquo;s there now.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s been up to the station twice to see if a Mr. Briblett
&rsquo;ad arrived, but there was no trace of
&rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Briblett,&rdquo; murmured the passenger, dazedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t&mdash;oh,
don&rsquo;t bother me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
ill&mdash;<i>ill</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Orace &rsquo;as kept out of &rsquo;er way all
the time, in case some one might &rsquo;ave seen &rsquo;im up at
the station this <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>morning,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
might begin to smell a rat before the bomb goes off, if she
starts putting questions to &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a certain inconsiderate vigour the two friends
half-lifted, half-dragged Mr. Briblett from the boat and assisted
him up the steps to the quay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A drop o&rsquo; brandy is the only thing to do this
poor gent any good,&rdquo; prescribed Mr. Lock, producing a
flask.</p>
<p>The stranger, although in a comatose condition, proved true to
his lifelong traditions, and feebly waved the stimulant
aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock, &ldquo;if &rsquo;e
won&rsquo;t drink it, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps the <i>smell</i> of it
might do &rsquo;im good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus speaking, he delicately sprinkled Mr. Briblett&rsquo;s
shoulder with a few drops of the spirit, and then very
fraternally shared the remainder with Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now off we goes!&rdquo; directed Mr. Lock, and,
supported by the two sailormen, the cadaverous Mr. Briblett
tottered forward on two swerving, unstable legs.&nbsp; Closed
were Mr. Briblett&rsquo;s eyes, and the expression on his face
was one of pained indifference to all mundane affairs.</p>
<p>By quiet side-streets was Mr. Briblett conducted to the
neighbourhood of the little shop in Fore Street.&nbsp; Rounding a
corner, the trio at last reached that emporium.&nbsp; Mr. Lock
remembered to knock Mr. Briblett&rsquo;s hat off for him,
retrieving it with sundry muddy adhesions, and replacing it on
the sufferer&rsquo;s head at a rakish angle.</p>
<p>Then the door of Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s shop flew open, the three
lurched over the threshold, and Mr. Dobb quickly flitted in after
them from nowhere.&nbsp; A moment later Mr. Clark and Mr. Lock
were exhaustedly mopping their foreheads, and their burden,
unceremoniously <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>dumped into a chair, was lolling back in his seat, too
indisposed even for protest at his treatment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, whatever&mdash;&rdquo; began
Horace&rsquo;s spouse, appearing in vast surprise at the inner
door.</p>
<p>Mr. Lock, perceiving a second female rising from a chair in
the back parlour, began to speak loudly and rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just found this chap lying &rsquo;elpless
at the corner of the road,&rdquo; he stated.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
brought &rsquo;im &rsquo;ere because &rsquo;e said &rsquo;e
wanted to find a Mrs. Jackson, sir, and we thought that
p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you might know the good lady.&nbsp; Though
whether she&rsquo;d care to admit to knowing him, I
shouldn&rsquo;t like to say, her being a most respectable lady,
by all accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E must &rsquo;ave been drinking the &rsquo;ole
of the day!&rdquo; observed Mr. Clark, in tones of righteous
contempt. &ldquo;I see &rsquo;im myself go into the &lsquo;Jolly
Sailors,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Blue Lion,&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;Cutlass and Cannon&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see &rsquo;im myself this morning,&rdquo; said
Horace.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see him come out of the station, and I
thought &rsquo;e looked a pretty queer fish.&nbsp; &rsquo;E come
straight out of the station and went into the &lsquo;Railway
Inn.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see &rsquo;im leave the &lsquo;Flag and
Pennant&rsquo; at dinner-time,&rdquo; contributed Mr. Lock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;E left there to go to the &lsquo;Royal
George&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brandy, too!&rdquo; intoned Mr. Clark,
sepulchrally.&nbsp; &ldquo;You just bend down and sniff.&nbsp; If
you can&rsquo;t smell brandy, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Briblett, raising his head with extreme difficulty, partly
opened his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; he demanded, weakly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m not at all well!&nbsp; I feel
ill&mdash;very ill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I should think!&rdquo; concurred Mr. Lock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And the language he was using!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>&ldquo;Said &rsquo;e&rsquo;d backed three winners out of
five yesterday, and didn&rsquo;t care if it snowed pink!&rdquo;
supplied Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wanted us to &rsquo;ave a game of &rsquo;apenny nap
with &rsquo;im on the steps of the Town Hall,&rdquo; added Mr.
Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said &rsquo;e&rsquo;d come down to see about a
&rsquo;air-dressing business, but it could go to&mdash;but
&rsquo;e wasn&rsquo;t going to trouble!&rdquo; stated Mr.
Clark.</p>
<p>As one existing on a plane of complete isolation, the stricken
Mr. Briblett rose unsteadily to his feet.&nbsp; Clutching at the
back of his chair, he swayed delicately a while, and then sat
down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to go to sleep,&rdquo; he
announced.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to go to sleep!&nbsp; I want to
lie down!&nbsp; Oh, I feel so queer!&nbsp; That boat, drifting
out to sea&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boat&mdash;sea!&rdquo; cried Mr. Clark, readily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There you are!&nbsp; Delirious, and no wonder!&nbsp;
Raving&mdash;raving!&nbsp; What a &rsquo;orrible hexample for all
right-minded men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little wait.&nbsp; Then Mrs. Jackson, coming out
of a sort of trance, pushed past her hostess and stepped through
the doorway of the back parlour.&nbsp; For three long seconds she
stared at Mr. Briblett, and then, drawing a deep breath, she
shrilly began to take the predominant part in the conversation. .
. .</p>
<p>Five minutes later Mr. Dobb, Mr. Clark, and Mr. Lock were
standing some streets away, dazedly fanning their brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow the dooce was I to know?&rdquo; whispered Mr.
Dobb, brokenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Ow the dooce was I to know
the chap would be so punctual as to be too early for the hexpress
and come straight along to see Mrs. Jackson at &rsquo;er
&rsquo;ome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hearers shook their heads in confession of inability to
answer the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;ow the dooce was I to know,&rdquo; continued
Mr. <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Dobb,
bitterly, &ldquo;that she&rsquo;d asked this other chap to come
down and &rsquo;elp &rsquo;er with &rsquo;er business affairs,
now &rsquo;e&rsquo;d got back to England after fifteen years in
the Colonies, and never been to Shore&rsquo;aven before to see
&rsquo;er?&nbsp; &rsquo;Ow the dooce was I to know? . . .&nbsp;
Why, I didn&rsquo;t even know she&rsquo;d <i>got</i> a
brother!&rdquo;</p>

75</span><i>EPISODE IV</i><br />
BLACK CATS ARE ALWAYS LUCKY</h2>
<p>It had been a day thickly veined and marbled with emotions for
the little group of men who, aforetime, had in some measure
controlled the sea-going vagaries of that decrepit old barque,
the &ldquo;Jane Gladys.&rdquo;&nbsp; For, that day, the
&ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo; had ceased to be a ship dowered with an
imposing collection of virtues perceptible only to the
auctioneer, and had become but so much old wood and rusting iron
to be exploited by the speculative marine-store dealer who
hazarded the highest price for her unlovely bulk.</p>
<p>This distressful climax in the nautical career of the
&ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo; was not allowed to go unwitnessed by
those who had so long lived and thrived amid the sinister shadows
of her ill-repute as a barque that was the natural home of venal
duplicities.&nbsp; The erstwhile crew of the &ldquo;Jane
Gladys,&rdquo; those established confederates in mercenary plot
and counterplot, had rallied to watch the transfer of their
stronghold into alien and unsympathetic ownership, and, in the
untroubled throng about the auctioneer, they stood as figures
thrust apart from their fellow-men by the stern arm of
Tragedy.</p>
<p>Captain Peter Dutt was there, his countenance a very show-case
of mournful reminiscence as he gazed upon his late command,
although he had retired ashore on a comfortable pension, and had
already taken to bragging about his extraordinary prowess as an
amateur <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>grower of vegetables.&nbsp; That venerable and corpulent
amphibian, Mr. Samuel Clark, was there, too, having contrived to
evade for a while his present duties as ferryman across
Shorehaven Harbour in order to attend this dismal chapter in the
history of the vessel upon which he had served for so many
years.&nbsp; And Mr. Horace Dobb, who formerly graced the
cook&rsquo;s galley of the doomed ship, was also in attendance in
the great glory of garb which was explained and justified by the
fact that he had married a widow and a snug second-hand business
at one fortunate sweep.</p>
<p>But, as may be inferred, the regrets of Captain Dutt, of Mr.
Clark, and of Mr. Dobb were almost entirely retrospective, for
their daily bread was assured.&nbsp; The future was firm ground
for their feet to tread, and their woeful deportment had
therefore merely a sentimental value.&nbsp; Far more earnest and
practical was the grief at the passing of the &ldquo;Jane
Gladys&rdquo; of the two remaining members of her old crew, Mr.
Peter Lock and Mr. Joseph Tridge.</p>
<p>Despite the assiduity with which these two gentlemen had of
late pointed out to the great god Luck ways by which he might
help them, that fickle deity had proved himself singularly
unresponsive.&nbsp; And this meant that neither Mr. Lock nor Mr.
Tridge had any attractive prospects to solace them for the loss
of their employment on the &ldquo;Jane Gladys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By personal inquiry they had discovered that no master mariner
was prepared to risk the morale of his crew by importing into the
fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle anyone who had been even remotely connected
with the &ldquo;Jane Gladys,&rdquo; nor was a task ashore
obtainable when once they had mentioned the only references they
could give.</p>
<p>True, Mr. Dobb had promised them his favour, but, <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>so far,
nothing had come of it save the abortive attempt to procure
employment for Mr. Tridge as a hairdresser.&nbsp; Not that there
was any question as to Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s sincerity of purpose,
for, in projecting philanthropies for his two unfortunate
shipmates, he was largely considering his own interests.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Strictly Business!&rdquo; was the self-chosen motto that
controlled Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s energies in every direction, and
always there was present in his mind the idea that profitable
disposal of stock from the shop in Fore Street might skilfully be
accelerated by the placing of his old accomplices of the
&ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo; in strategic situations about the
town.</p>
<p>But, apart from securing Mr. Samuel Clark his present job, Mr.
Dobb&rsquo;s efforts had hitherto been negligible in result, and
now, of those who mourned the end of the &ldquo;Jane
Gladys,&rdquo; none mourned her with more genuine feeling or with
a greater sense of personal bereavement than Mr. Lock and Mr.
Tridge, for others were only mourning for memories, while they
were mourning a lost home.</p>
<p>Gradually, however, as the day had worn on, they had struggled
with and overcome their melancholy, mounting, indeed in the end
to a flippant hilarity which fitted but incongruously with the
gravity of their prospects.</p>
<p>But this was not till the day was nearing its close.&nbsp; The
early afternoon had been a space of sighs and doleful
head-shakings, for, at the close of the sale, Captain Dutt had
led his old subordinates into the &ldquo;Turk&rsquo;s
Head,&rdquo; and here they had all spoken so wistfully and
reverently about the &ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo; that the landlady
had wondered how one of them could have come back wearing a green
and pink tie from a funeral.</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>Mr.
Horace Dobb, not averse from exhibiting the opulence of his new
sphere in life to his former skipper, competed with that worthy
for the honour of being prime host to the party.&nbsp; It was a
challenge which Captain Dutt&rsquo;s pride forbade him to refuse,
and so round after round of refreshment was served, till by
degrees a brisker mood descended upon the company.</p>
<p>It was not till past tea-time that the party had begun to
break up.&nbsp; Mr. Clark was the first to leave, having suddenly
remembered that he had faithfully promised to return to the ferry
at one o&rsquo;clock sharp.&nbsp; And next Mr. Dobb went,
pleading the calls of business, and purchasing a cigar at the bar
as he left, with excellent effect.&nbsp; For Captain Dutt, after
silently and disapprovingly considering such an action on an
ex-cook&rsquo;s part, at last stigmatized it as a kind of
Socialism, and bought Mr. Lock and Mr. Tridge a cigar apiece to
re-establish his prestige.</p>
<p>Soon after, Captain Dutt reluctantly announced that he, too,
must now depart, and Messrs. Tridge and Lock accompanied him to
the nearest draper&rsquo;s shop, where he sagely selected a
bonnet to be presented to Mrs. Dutt the moment he got home.&nbsp;
And when the skipper, already holding the hat-box before him in a
propitiatory manner, had passed from their sight round a corner,
Mr. Tridge and Mr. Lock looked hard and remindedly at each other,
and then made search in their pockets.</p>
<p>As a result, the one party produced a shilling and five
pennies, and the other party disclosed a florin and a halfpenny;
frank and unabashed confession admitted these coins to be
&ldquo;change&rdquo; which the skipper had forgotten to pick up
amid the mental distractions of the afternoon.</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>Whereupon, congratulating themselves and each other on
this presence of mind in face of opportunity, Mr. Lock and Mr.
Tridge had retired to the tap-room of the &ldquo;Royal
William,&rdquo; and had there abundantly developed their policy
of drowning dull care.</p>
<p>By now the night was well advanced, and a fevered, reckless
brilliance was illuminating Mr. Lock&rsquo;s personality,
lighting up all those manifold polite accomplishments of which he
was a master.&nbsp; Thus, he had entertained the company with a
series of imitations of bird-calls, and performed clever feats of
legerdemain with corks and pennies and hats.</p>
<p>Mr. Tridge was in complete eclipse.&nbsp; He had tried hard to
be not ungenial, but his temperament was different from Mr.
Lock&rsquo;s, and every minute of revelry only found him more and
more subdued and morose.&nbsp; He had struggled against this
psychological handicap, even to the extent of exhibiting to the
company four or five styles of dancing with which he was
familiar, but so morose and forbidding was his countenance as he
jigged and gyrated that none dared claim his attention by
offering applause, so that when he sat down again it was amid
complete and discouraging silence.</p>
<p>Mr. Lock, however, shone still more effulgently as the evening
progressed.&nbsp; Knotting his handkerchief into semblance of a
doll, he affected that it was a wife and that he was its husband,
and built up on these premises a highly diverting ventriloquial
monologue.</p>
<p>And, after that, he successfully introduced some farmyard
mimicry, and then got well away with card tricks.&nbsp;
Appreciative, and even enthusiastic, were Mr. Lock&rsquo;s
audience, and none was more enthusiastic or appreciative than the
plump, fresh-faced little landlord of the &ldquo;Royal
William.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not once, nor twice, but thrice, did <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>he pay
tribute to Mr. Lock&rsquo;s powers in the medium most gratifying
to that artist, and his flow of hospitality ceased only when a
big and stern-visaged lady came presently and stood behind the
bar at his side.&nbsp; And, thereafter, the licensee of the
&ldquo;Royal William&rdquo; took, as it were, but a furtive and
subsidiary interest in Mr. Lock&rsquo;s entertainment; while the
lady eyed the performance with a cold hostility which was
inimical to true art.</p>
<p>And whether it was that Mr. Lock grew a little flustered under
her malign regard, or whether it was that he sought to sting the
landlord into revolt against domestic oppression, the fact
remains that he began to intersperse his card tricks with
humorous, but inflammatory, remarks bearing on the subject of
domineering wives and too submissive husbands.</p>
<p>It is possible that the landlord of the &ldquo;Royal
William&rdquo; derived amusement from these sallies.&nbsp;
Certainly his eyes gleamed at each thrust, and more than once he
turned away to conceal a grin, but he was too craven to exhibit
open hilarity at Mr. Lock&rsquo;s satires.&nbsp; The landlady,
however, did not hesitate to betray her feelings in the matter,
and thus it was that, at the tail of an amusing anecdote of
domestic tyranny, Mr. Lock found himself confronted with a stern
and acidulated request to sit down and keep quiet unless he
wished to find himself in trouble.</p>
<p>Mr. Lock, a little nonplussed, glanced at the landlord to
enlist his support.&nbsp; The landlord&rsquo;s gaze was
apologetic but unhelpful.&nbsp; Mr. Lock looked around among his
admirers, but their demeanour had become absent and
constrained.&nbsp; Mr. Lock turned and regarded Mr. Tridge; Mr.
Tridge was wrapped in his own sable <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>meditations.&nbsp; Pettishly, Mr.
Lock flung down the pack of cards and sulked in a corner.</p>
<p>The landlady, having thus suppressed unwelcome propaganda,
indulged in a tight-lipped smile of triumph, and began a rinsing
of glasses.&nbsp; The hush deepened in the room, developing an
atmosphere which brought Mr. Lock back to remembrance of his own
insecure position in the world, and this was rendered still more
discomforting by what followed.&nbsp; For an amiable gentleman in
a check coat, after twice clearing his throat, sought to
re-establish light conversation, and asked the landlord whether
there was yet any news of Ted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a letter from him,&rdquo; answered the landlord,
coming out of a sort of thoughtful trance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanking you for all the kindnesses you&rsquo;ve showed
him, I lay,&rdquo; hazarded the checkered gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned the landlord, slowly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;E only asked me to send on after him a pair of
boots he&rsquo;d left behind for mendin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy bothering about boots!&rdquo; marvelled the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;If my uncle died and left <i>me</i> a
greengrocery shop&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a nice little business, too, by all
accounts,&rdquo; struck in an individual in a mackintosh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, by <i>his</i> accounts,&rdquo; agreed the
landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;If half he said was true, he won&rsquo;t
have to do any more billiard-marking and odd-jobbing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while the money lasts, at any rate,&rdquo; said the
man in the mackintosh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you got anyone to take
his place yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlord, shaking his head, replied that he had not yet
found a successor to Ted.&nbsp; Billiard-markers, he added, were
scarce; people who desired employment as such were, as a rule, of
one or two unsatisfactory classes, knowing either too little or
too much.</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>Mr.
Lock, assimilating this talk, lifted his eyes and peered as it
were through the mists of his troubles.&nbsp; Here, obviously,
was a vacancy going, and one which he was well qualified to fill,
for his knowledge of the billiard table was neither elementary
nor academic.&nbsp; A post as a marker and odd-job man at the
&ldquo;Royal William&rdquo; appealed with equal force to his
temperament and his talents.&nbsp; He could conceive of no form
of employment more compatible with his desires.&nbsp; He almost
groaned with mortification at the thought that he had allowed a
<i>faux pas</i> to ruin his chances of so delectable a
situation.</p>
<p>None the less, he determined to make sure that his opportunity
was indeed irrevocably lost, and, to that end, when the landlady
had temporarily quitted the apartment, he sidled up to the host
of the &ldquo;Royal William,&rdquo; and put a blunt inquiry to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No chance whatever!&rdquo; answered that worthy,
regretfully shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find me just the sort of chap you
want,&rdquo; pleaded Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt of it,&rdquo; accepted the
landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it was only me what had the say, you
could start to-morrow.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind admitting
straight to your face that I&rsquo;ve took to you.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve got a civil, well-bred, amoosin&rsquo; way with
you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d get on like a house afire with the gents
in the billiard-room.&nbsp; But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head again, sighed, and left the ellipsis to
carry its own implication.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The missis, eh?&rdquo; said Mr. Lock, sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The missis,&rdquo; agreed the landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it &rsquo;ud be no good my trying
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It &rsquo;ud be no good your trying anything!&rdquo;
interrupted the landlord, with conviction.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can
bet <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>she&rsquo;s got her knife into you, and you can bet
nothing &rsquo;ud please her more than to twist it round like a
corkscrew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I had a job here,&rdquo; contended Mr. Lock,
&ldquo;she&rsquo;d have a lot more chances to twist
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, I&rsquo;d give you the job if I dared, but I
dare not, and that&rsquo;s flat and honest,&rdquo; said the
landlord, earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t!&nbsp;
See?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how it is&mdash;I daren&rsquo;t!&nbsp;
But here she comes; <i>you</i> can ask her about it, if you
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlady, returning, bent a gaze of extreme displeasure on
both Mr. Lock and her husband at finding them in commune.&nbsp;
Mr. Lock, studying her countenance but the briefest while, turned
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it matters,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later the law&rsquo;s exigency emptied the
&ldquo;Royal William.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fresh air outside
immediately had a restorative effect on Mr. Lock&rsquo;s spirits,
giving back to him his normal buoyancy, so that he shed his
worries like a mantle, and became again his gay and debonair
self.&nbsp; Mr. Tridge, however, had come to a slow and obstinate
truculency of mood, and avowed an open antagonism to all
mankind.&nbsp; And this divergency of outlook led to an
unfortunate sequel, for, as they made their way back to the ship,
which was only to continue as their home until the formalities of
her sale had been completed, a black cat shot across their path,
and Mr. Lock gleefully hailed its transit as a fortunate
omen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Black cats are always lucky!&rdquo; declared
Mr. Lock, with elation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar!&rdquo; churlishly declared Mr.
Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are!&rdquo; insisted Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll prove you&rsquo;re a liar!&rdquo; cried
Mr. Tridge, <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>irately, and forthwith struck Mr. Lock a grevious blow
on the right eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere&mdash;steady!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Oo are you giving orders to?&rdquo; bellowed Mr.
Tridge, in high passion, and straightway smote Mr. Lock&rsquo;s
left eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Now</i> do you think black cats are
always lucky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lock, sitting down on a convenient doorstep, pressed his
palms to his eyes, too engrossed in a species of private
astronomy to reply to Mr. Tridge&rsquo;s question.&nbsp; Mr.
Tridge, as one who had creditably sustained the truth of his
assertions, cocked his head proudly and walked on.&nbsp; Mr.
Lock, recovering after a while, followed him with marked caution,
nor did he attempt reprisals.&nbsp; But this magnanimity was less
because he knew that no one would be more surprised and
apologetic on the morrow over the occurrence than Mr. Tridge,
than because Mr. Tridge was altogether a larger and more powerful
man than Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>Mr. Tridge, achieving the &ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo; in grim
solitude, made his simple preparations for slumber, and lay down
in his bunk with a sigh of weary content.&nbsp; He was fast
asleep ere Mr. Lock ventured down to the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle and
wooed repose.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Strewth!&rdquo; cried Mr. Tridge, in utter
amazement, waking next morning.</p>
<p>Mr. Lock, who had just risen reluctantly to dress, turned an
inquiring gaze on his shipmate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Now</i> what is it?&rdquo; he asked, petulantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Strewth!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Tridge again,
staring incredulously at the polychromatic setting of Mr.
Lock&rsquo;s <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Peter, you <i>must</i> &rsquo;ave
been a-going it last night!&rdquo; he added, with intense
conviction.&nbsp; &ldquo;My word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&nbsp; No worse than you!&rdquo; denied Mr.
Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must &rsquo;ave got to scrapping,&rdquo; surmised
Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you win or lose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; sourly questioned Mr. Lock.
&ldquo;I never scrapped with no one.&nbsp; I was&mdash;I was
imitating canaries.&nbsp; Canaries don&rsquo;t scrap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow did you get them two awful big black eyes,
then?&rdquo; wonderingly queried Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black eyes?&rdquo; murmured Mr. Lock, perplexed.
&ldquo;Black eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black and red and green and yaller and blue and purple
and horange,&rdquo; supplemented Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>Mr. Lock crossed to the little mirror which hung on the
shelf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I &rsquo;ave!&rdquo; he said, in blank
surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;So I &rsquo;ave!&nbsp; I thought it was
only the front part of my &rsquo;eadache!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two real beauties!&rdquo; declared Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You must &rsquo;ave got nasty over something, Peter.&nbsp;
Why didn&rsquo;t you leave it to me to do your scrapping for you,
like we always does?&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave got
&rsquo;it like that, you can bet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lock, disturbed by the discovery, sat down on the edge of
his bunk and shook his head, an action which caused him such
discomfort that he lay down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you remember &rsquo;ow it &rsquo;appened,
Peter?&rdquo; asked Mr. Tridge, with genuine sympathy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you can remember the chap <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> step along
and square up with &rsquo;im for you,&rdquo; he promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to remember,&rdquo; said Mr.
Lock.&nbsp; <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it was a scrap, though.&nbsp;
I believe it was a hexaplosion somewhere.&nbsp; I seem to
remember a lot of sparks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I come to think of it, I seem to remember a fire or
something,&rdquo; murmured Mr. Tridge, after mental
gropings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Or was it something to do with the
&rsquo;arbour-master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The twain lay silent, striving to recollect the cause of the
alteration to Mr. Lock&rsquo;s countenance, and they were still
silently seeking to establish the origin of the disaster when Mr.
Horace Dobb made his appearance in the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you &rsquo;ave a good time last&mdash;&rdquo;
he began, and then broke off at sight of Mr. Lock&rsquo;s
contused features.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, I see you did!&rdquo; he
ended, sapiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Both</i> of &rsquo;em!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I
can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; mused Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Both</i> of &rsquo;em!&nbsp; &rsquo;E must &rsquo;ave
been carrying something in his arms at the time, that&rsquo;s the
only way I can hexplain it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow did it &rsquo;appen, Peter?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Dobb, curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember yet whether it was a man or the
hact of providence,&rdquo; confessed Mr. Lock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a headache and can&rsquo;t think
clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity,&rdquo; commented Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come down to see you on a little matter of
business, but if you ain&rsquo;t equal to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking business always clears my &rsquo;ead,&rdquo;
said Mr. Lock, eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you found me a job,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found you a road leading to a job,&rdquo; amended Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can put you on it, but you must walk up it
yourself.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ow do you like the hidea of going around
with a milk-cart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; frankly returned Mr. Lock.</p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do you all right to go on
with,&rdquo; urged Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to
find something to do, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Lock in a milk-cart!&rdquo; marvelled Mr.
Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;A <i>milk</i>-cart!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t that
just show you what a rum world this is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t half get chaffed!&rdquo; foretold Mr.
Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t keep it longer than it takes you to
find a better job,&rdquo; pointed out Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Meanwhile, you&rsquo;ll be remaining in Shore&rsquo;aven
&rsquo;ere, and we shall all be in touch with each other, like
what we&rsquo;ve always planned on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a milk-cart!&rdquo; protested Mr. Lock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now, if it &rsquo;ad been a wine and spirit
shop&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of all the pretty gals you&rsquo;ll be
&rsquo;anding in cans to!&rdquo; recommended Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s got its bright side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to think of it, it ain&rsquo;t such a bad
job,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Lock, brightening.&nbsp; &ldquo;When do I
start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to get the job first,&rdquo; Mr. Dobb
reminded him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to play up for
it very careful and polite and artful, and that&rsquo;s why I
thought it was a better chance for you than for Joe, there.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a old geezer, a Mrs. Golightly, what you&rsquo;ll
&rsquo;ave to be hextra special hattentive to.&nbsp; &rsquo;Er
&rsquo;usband runs a grocery shop, and she&rsquo;s going to start
the dairy business as a side-line in a week or two.&nbsp; You
play your cards right, and the job is yours for the asking.&nbsp;
You see, you&rsquo;re going to do the old geezer a favour before
she knows what you&rsquo;re after, and that&rsquo;s always a big
&rsquo;elp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb paused and pointed impressively at Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one of the finest amytoor animal doctors
in England,&rdquo; he told him.</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>&ldquo;Ho, am I?&rdquo; said Mr. Lock, casually.&nbsp;
&ldquo;First I&rsquo;ve heard of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same &rsquo;ere till a hour ago,&rdquo; returned Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only I &rsquo;appened to be talking with
&rsquo;er, and one thing led to another, and then I see you just
&rsquo;ad to be good at animal doctoring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, because you&rsquo;re going to cure &rsquo;er pet
cat of fits for &rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; remarked Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Ow
do I do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for you to decide,&rdquo; answered Mr.
Dobb, easily.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be the beginning of your
job in the milk line.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s lucky she&rsquo;s got a
pet cat with fits, ain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a black cat,
too.&nbsp; Black cats,&rdquo; he stated, dogmatically, &ldquo;are
always lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At mention of these words a swift tremor coursed through Mr.
Lock&rsquo;s frame, and he sat up in his bunk, staring hard at
Mr. Tridge, and gradually raising a rigid forearm to point
accusingly at him.&nbsp; A similar start of surprise pulsed
through Mr. Tridge, and after a long, horrified stare at Mr.
Lock&rsquo;s damaged optics, he suddenly turned on his mattress
and guiltily drew his blankets over his head.&nbsp; Mr. Dobb,
viewing this by-play in surprise, offered the theory that his
friends were rehearsing for employment as kinema actors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know who done it now!&rdquo; cried Mr. Lock,
bitterly. &ldquo;And so does he!&nbsp; It was you talking about
black cats, &rsquo;Orace, what done it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I done what by talking about black cats?&rdquo;
demanded the mystified Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>Mr. Lock irately made the situation clear to Mr. Dobb, who, as
soon as he had regained composure, assumed the role of peacemaker
so successfully that ere <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>long Mr. Tridge was encouraged to
emerge again from beneath his blankets and promise all manner of
recompense to Mr. Lock at some future date when liberality should
be more convenient.&nbsp; This understanding reached, Mr. Dobb
returned to the object of his call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon as ever Mrs. Golightly told me about &rsquo;er cat
&rsquo;aving fits,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, &ldquo;I thought at once
of you, Peter.&nbsp; Remember that cat you cured of hiccups at
Teignmouth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>said</i> it was cured,&rdquo; shamelessly
corrected Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never went back to see once
I&rsquo;d got the money for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, you can <i>start</i> to cure this old
geezer&rsquo;s cat for &rsquo;er, can&rsquo;t you?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve got till next&rsquo; Saturday aboard this old boat,
&rsquo;aven&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Well, suppose you get the cat and
bring it &rsquo;ere, and keep it with you till then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock, readily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
I can take it back to &rsquo;er and say I&rsquo;m sorry, but
I&rsquo;m leaving the town to find work elsewhere; and what a
pity it is, seeing that the cat&rsquo;s so much better already
under my treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the hidea, Peter!&rdquo; concurred Mr.
Dobb. &ldquo;The old gal is regularly wrapped up in that
cat.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t make more fuss of it if she
tried.&nbsp; And &rsquo;er &rsquo;usband is very fond of it,
too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more like a nursery than anything else when
that cat comes into the room, and to &rsquo;ear &rsquo;em both
sit round hencouraging it to eat its meals!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like
a baby spending a day with its grandparents!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be very grateful if I can cure it of
fits,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock, thoughtfully; &ldquo;and if I
&rsquo;aven&rsquo;t had time enough to do it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll pretty well offer you that job in the
milk <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>line
without being asked, simply to keep you near your patient,&rdquo;
prophesied Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;You dress yourself now and come
along with me, and you&rsquo;ll see what a simple, easy affair it
is to a smart chap like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; said Mr. Lock severely to Mr. Tridge.
&ldquo;Black cats <i>are</i> always lucky, after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later Mr. Lock, furnished with a very
circumstantial story about a carriage accident to account for the
spectacular state of his features, had the felicity of being
introduced to Mrs. Golightly and her husband by Mr. Horace
Dobb.&nbsp; The conventions of etiquette thus fulfilled, Mr. Dobb
came straight to the point of the business in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s going to do you a favour and cure that
&rsquo;ere cat of yours, ain&rsquo;t you, Peter?&rdquo; he
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All being well, yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock,
modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If <i>you</i> can&rsquo;t cure it, no one can!&rdquo;
gushed Mr. Dobb. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wonder at curing animals,
Peter, and you knows that&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; Remember that dog
you cured for the dook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lock, carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the blood&rsquo;ound,&rdquo; answered Mr.
Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant, which dook?&rdquo; said Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the one what give you the gold watch and
chain,&rdquo; replied Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Show &rsquo;em to
Mrs. Golightly, Peter; she&rsquo;d like to see
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lock&rsquo;s hand made a movement towards his waistcoat,
and then checked itself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; he said,
with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;I left it at the bank in London, along
with all them other testimonials and medals I&rsquo;ve got for
animal doctoring.&nbsp; A chap what lives a travelling, seafaring
life,&rdquo; he explained to the lady, &ldquo;needs to be careful
of his property.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; she assented.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I wonder you don&rsquo;t give up the sea and settle
down ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So &rsquo;e means to one day,&rdquo; struck in Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s going to give up seafaring
and animal-curing, ain&rsquo;t you, Peter, and settle down quiet
and peaceful ashore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a nice, quiet, respectable job, when I find one to
suit me,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if you&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo; began the lady,
and then paused.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t mind
seeing poor Jonathan now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lock professing readiness to interview his prospective
patient, both Mr. and Mrs. Golightly bustled from the room,
making loud and endearing appeal to the stricken feline to come
and be shown to the kind gentleman.&nbsp; Left alone, Mr. Lock
and Mr. Dobb winked very pleasantly at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as yours, that job is, Peter,&rdquo;
said Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;She nearly offered it to you just now
of &rsquo;er own accord.&nbsp; Did you &rsquo;ear
&rsquo;er?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve made a &rsquo;it there, Peter, my
boy!&nbsp; Keep it up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Golightly, returning presently with an
undistinguished-looking black cat in her arms, postponed
consideration of its condition while she delivered an
affectionate address on the manifold virtues of the animal.&nbsp;
Mr. Lock, after gravely listening to the tale of so much
excellence, plainly enhanced his favour with the good dame by
remarking that the cat reminded him very much of a similar
animal, the property of a countess, which he had cured of
sunstroke in two days.&nbsp; He added that the countess&rsquo;s
gratitude was most touching and substantial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Golightly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
do &rsquo;ope you ain&rsquo;t going to charge me very, very much
for curing Jonathan!&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t a countess, not by no
means.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t dream of charging you anything,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
already took a great fancy to this cat, for one thing, and for
another, I believe we all ought to do folks good turns whenever
we get the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He now bent professionally over the cat, felt all the joints
in its tail in a highly technical manner, and then gravely
studied its eyes.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Golightly, watching him,
awaited his verdict in breathless suspense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can and shall be cured,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I can do it in the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within the hour the afflicted animal had taken up temporary
residence on board the &ldquo;Jane Gladys.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sundry
dainties which had, at Mr. Lock&rsquo;s instruction, been secured
for the patient&rsquo;s diet served as an excellent dinner that
day for two impecunious mariners.&nbsp; An indignant black cat
found that &ldquo;rest and quiet&rdquo; were terms interpreted on
the &ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo; by enforced seclusion in a
sea-chest while the human occupants of the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle
enjoyed a protracted siesta after their meal.&nbsp; Indeed, it
was only when a late tea had restored full energy to Mr. Lock
that he recollected the needs of his patient.&nbsp; A foray in
the galley was rewarded with the discovery of a red herring in a
dark corner, and, armed with this booty, Mr. Lock prepared to
inaugurate an altered course of dietetics for his patient.</p>
<p>Cautiously he raised the lid of the chest, but not cautiously
enough; for the black cat, wearied of solitary confinement,
slipped through the opening, and, easily dodging the convulsive
clutch of Mr. Lock and the outstretched hands of the interested
Mr. Tridge, it streaked out of the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle and up on
to the deck.&nbsp; Mr. Lock&rsquo;s ill-timed recriminations of
Mr. Tridge&rsquo;s clumsiness caused a regrettable delay in
pursuit, and <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>when at last the two sailormen had reached the deck, the
black cat had completely vanished in the darkness.</p>
<p>Frenzied and exhaustive search was made, only to be abandoned
in the end when sundry sportive souls on the wharf took to jocund
mimicry of the enticing calls made by Mr. Lock and his
companion.&nbsp; Loudly did Mr. Lock bewail so inauspicious and
swift a termination to his high hopes of the conduct of a
milk-cart.</p>
<p>And moodily did he make his way to Fore Street, there to seek
Mr. Dobb in his home, and tell him of this underhand trick which
the cat had played upon one who had desired to deal benevolently
by it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no good crying over spilt
milk-carts,&rdquo; pronounced Mr. Dobb, when his visitor began to
sorrow over the wreck of his ambitions.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
got to be up and doing&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; As long as
that cat don&rsquo;t turn up at its old &rsquo;ome, you&rsquo;ve
always got a chance of finding it again somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we don&rsquo;t find it, though?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things might be worse even then,&rdquo; said Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he hinted, &ldquo;one black
cat is very like another.&nbsp; And they can&rsquo;t talk and
give things away, can they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Lock, immensely relieved.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And, besides, a cat that&rsquo;s been taken away to be
cured of fits ain&rsquo;t hardly likely to look quite the same
when it comes back again, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A nod of perfect understanding passed between these two keen
tacticians, and Mr. Dobb promised that he would take care to call
frequently at the residence of the Golightlys to ascertain
whether Jonathan was controlled by homing instincts sufficiently
serviceable to lead him back to his mistress.&nbsp; In that
deplorable event, it was decided that action must depend upon the
<a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>inspiration of the moment.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, Mr.
Lock expressed his firm intention of securing another black cat
from somewhere, and making its escape a matter of impossibility
this time.</p>
<p>And thus it was that Mr. Lock, going wistfully about the
environs of the harbour at a late hour that night at last managed
to track down and capture an animal of the species and colour
that he desired.&nbsp; He conveyed his protesting prisoner
swiftly aboard the &ldquo;Jane Gladys,&rdquo; and there he
extemporized for it a prison system from which not even a cat
provided with a burglar&rsquo;s kit and the ability to use it
could have escaped.</p>
<p>For three days did Mr. Lock keep close watch and ward over his
captive.&nbsp; Mr. Robb, on reconnoitring duty, was able to tell
him that the vanished Jonathan had not yet put in an appearance
at his home, and that the Golightlys were looking forward with
the liveliest emotions of thankfulness to the moment which should
restore to them their pet cured of its ailment by Mr.
Lock&rsquo;s veterinary skill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; put forward Mr. Tridge, one
afternoon, in a pessimistic mood&mdash;&ldquo;s&rsquo;pose that
that there first cat turns up at &rsquo;is old &rsquo;ome one day
after you&rsquo;ve got your other cat settled there.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;ll be awkward, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; vaunted Mr. Lock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall be working at the place by then, so it&rsquo;s a
&rsquo;undred to one that I shall catch sight of it first, and
then there won&rsquo;t be no fatted calf killed for the returned
prodigal, you can bet.&nbsp; I shall just collar it and shove it
in a sack and come down and have a look to see how the old
harbour is getting on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but s&rsquo;pose you ain&rsquo;t on the
spot?&rdquo; persisted Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
&rsquo;appens then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I shall swear it can&rsquo;t be their beloved <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>Jonathan,
because &rsquo;e&rsquo;d never &rsquo;ave left my sight while I
&rsquo;ad &rsquo;im &rsquo;ere, so the new-comer must be a
stray.&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;ll manage them all right, don&rsquo;t
you fret!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next morning Mr. Lock arrayed himself in his best, shaved
himself to a miracle of velvet smoothness, and brushed his hair
with extraordinary interest, for he purposed now to restore the
pseudo-Jonathan to its expectant master and mistress, and to
bring diplomacy to bear upon the securing of the coveted post of
chaperone to a milk-cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity my eyes don&rsquo;t lose a bit of their
colour,&rdquo; he observed, studying his reflection in the
glass.&nbsp; &ldquo;They look just as black as they did when we
first &rsquo;ad that little dispute, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look as if you might only &rsquo;ave got them last
night,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my soul,
they makes me feel almost like a bad character myself, just to be
talking to &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lock, recognizing the futility of wishes, dropped the
subject and took up the imprisoned cat.&nbsp; Slipping it into a
hamper, he set off up town with it, and speedily came to the home
of the Golightlys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s you cat, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said
to that lady, handing the animal over to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, that&rsquo;s never our Jonathan!&rdquo; cried the
lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t he look well?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lock, with
enthusiasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon he&rsquo;s more than half cured
by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but this is ever so much bigger than our dear
old Jonathan,&rdquo; objected the lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bigger
and&mdash;and stouter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the treatment and diet I give
&rsquo;im,&rdquo; explained Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;It always
&rsquo;as that effect on my patients.&nbsp; It puts on weight and
improves their coat wonderful.&nbsp; Ah, I never grudged him
nothing!&nbsp; The best of <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>everything he&rsquo;s had, even
though I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad to go short myself
sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he certainly is wonderfully improved,&rdquo; said
the lady, gratefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ardly
have ever known &rsquo;im.&nbsp; And in that short time,
too!&nbsp; &rsquo;Owever did you do it, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trade secret,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he don&rsquo;t seem to take much notice of
me,&rdquo; said the lady, a little disappointedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Before he went away, when I used to speak to him,
&rsquo;e&rsquo;d look back at me and mew like a Christian; but
now &rsquo;e don&rsquo;t even seem to like me &rsquo;olding
&rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit strange to &rsquo;im at present,
that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Mr. Lock assured her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;ll be loving and affectionate to you again
very soon.&nbsp; And, as for &rsquo;is fits&mdash;well, I can
take my solemn gospel oath that he ain&rsquo;t even had a attempt
at one all the time &rsquo;e&rsquo;s been in my
charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How splendid!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Golightly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he looks heaps better.&nbsp; You must
&rsquo;ave took good care of &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Mr. Lock asserted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never let
him out of my sight for a single moment.&nbsp; Brushed and combed
him three times a day, fed him on tid-bits, give him his physic
regular with an oyster after it to take the taste of it out of
his mouth, and used to sit by &rsquo;is side at night till he
fell off to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been good to him!&rdquo; cried the lady, moved
by such devotion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish I could make it right with
you, some&rsquo;ow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I done it because I took a fancy to the cat,&rdquo;
said Mr. Lock, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t want no reward.&nbsp; I
shall miss the old chap, though,&rdquo; he went on, lowering his
voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to part with him, for his sake as
well as my own.&nbsp; If he could only have had a bit longer
under <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>my
care, he&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave been cured for good and all of them
fits.&nbsp; As it is, there&rsquo;s always the chance that they
may come on after a while, and I&rsquo;ll be far away by
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but can&rsquo;t you stop here in
Shorehaven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mum.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got my living to earn, and
there ain&rsquo;t a job going here that would suit me.&nbsp; I
want to give up the sea.&nbsp; I used to be a milkman afore I was
a sailor, and naturally I&rsquo;d like to take on the job of
milkman again, only there ain&rsquo;t no vacancies in this
&rsquo;ere town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just where you&rsquo;re wrong!&rdquo;
cried the lady, in high good humour.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
starting a dairy business here next week, and I&rsquo;m looking
out for a man to take the milk-round!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; breathed Mr. Lock, &ldquo;if ever
there was a coincidence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ceased abruptly, for sometimes Coincidence has two long
arms and uses both simultaneously.&nbsp; Mr. Lock, gazing
spellbound at the doorway, saw Mr. Golightly framed in it, and
clasped in Mr. Golightly&rsquo;s embrace was a black cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jonathan!&rdquo; stated Mr. Golightly, simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; screamed the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just found him outside the back door, mewing enough to
break his heart,&rdquo; said her husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at
him!&nbsp; Covered in mud, half starved&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t your cat!&rdquo; denied Mr.
Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s only a mangy old stray
you&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;old of.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s your Jonathan
in the fire-place there.&nbsp; Cured and improved out of all
recognition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Golightly picked up both cats and set them side by
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jonathan!&rdquo; she called, and the cat that Mr. Lock
had brought foolishly strove to get up the chimney, <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>while the
other animal, uttering a half-plaintive, half-delighted mew,
tottered forward to lick the lady&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never let him out of my sight&rsquo;!&rdquo;
cried Mrs. Golightly.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Washed and brushed him
every day!&nbsp; Fed him on all the best!&nbsp; Sat by &rsquo;im
till &rsquo;e went off&mdash;&rsquo;!&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere!&rdquo;
she ended, fiercely.&nbsp; &ldquo;You go off&mdash;now&mdash;this
minute!&nbsp; Else&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lock, ever one to recognize defeat, turned to take his
departure.&nbsp; Mrs. Golightly, retrieving the alien cat from
the chimney, thrust it into the hamper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, take your rubbish with you!&rdquo; she
ordered; and, thus encumbered, Mr. Lock took his departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blest if I am so sure that black cats are always
lucky!&rdquo; he murmured, dazedly.</p>
<p>At the corner of the road he ran into Mr. Horace Dobb.&nbsp;
Mr. Dobb was in a state of considerable excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t left that cat at the
Golightlys&rsquo; yet, then?&rdquo; he observed, with
relief.&nbsp; And, taking Mr. Lock by the arm, eagerly dragged
him forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, then, the Golightlys &rsquo;ave
lost their second chance of a cat, that&rsquo;s all!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ere, come on in &rsquo;ere!&rdquo; he directed, turning
into the &ldquo;Royal William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aggressive landlady and the cheerful little landlord were
behind the counter.&nbsp; At Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s entry, they both
turned expectantly towards him, and the severity of the landlady
perceptively waned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s the young fellow I spoke about just
now!&rdquo; cried Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at the state of
&rsquo;is eyes, and you can see I was telling the
truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;as &rsquo;e got it there in the
basket?&rdquo; asked the landlord, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E &rsquo;as!&rdquo; declared Mr. Dobb, and,
unfastening the lid of the hamper, he allowed its occupant to
escape.</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &rsquo;im!&rdquo; cried the
landlord, raptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our dear, dear little lost one!&rdquo;
shrilled the lady, in happy agitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a trump!&rdquo; declared the
landlord, turning to Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;This gent &rsquo;ere
&rsquo;as been telling us all about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mr. Lock, lamely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; answered the landlord.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We &rsquo;appened to mention to &rsquo;im that our cat was
missing, and &rsquo;e told us &rsquo;ow &rsquo;e knew of a cat
what &rsquo;ad been saved from torture by a sailorman.&nbsp;
There was a great big &rsquo;ulking chap and another chap
&rsquo;ad got &rsquo;old of our cat,&rdquo; narrated the
landlord, &ldquo;and you see &rsquo;em ill-treating it, and you
interfered, and they knocked you about cruel, and give you two
terrible black eyes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they are terrible, too!&rdquo; said the landlady,
with a sympathetic shudder.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must &rsquo;ave
suffered, young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you saved our pet!&rdquo; cried the landlord.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You see, that gent there&rsquo;s been telling us all about
it!&nbsp; It come out quite by accident, to&mdash;we was talking
about billiard-marking; that was what led up to it,
some&rsquo;ow.&nbsp; Anyway, you saved our cat, and me and my
missis are very grateful to you for it.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;ve
been keeping it till you felt less knocked about, and then you
were going to try and find its home!&nbsp; Well, you&rsquo;re
saved that trouble, anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what I saw of you the other night,&rdquo;
confessed the landlady, &ldquo;I should never have thought you
could have behaved so noble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Husband and wife now retired apart for a brief whispered
colloquy.&nbsp; Within one minute of its conclusion, Mr. Lock had
been offered and had accepted the <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>vacant post of billiard-marker and
odd-job man to the &ldquo;Royal William&rdquo;. . . .</p>
<p>Late that same night, Mr. Tridge ceased undressing and looked
across at Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Peter!&rdquo; he admitted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They <i>are</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said Mr. Horace Dobb, coming out of a long
meditative silence, &ldquo;&rsquo;ave you ever &rsquo;ad words
with a prize-fighter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Joseph Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And only once!&nbsp; Never no more for me!&rdquo; he
ended, very definitely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What &rsquo;appened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I started to &rsquo;ave words with
&rsquo;im,&rdquo; returned Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; prompted Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; stated Mr. Tridge, simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did &rsquo;e &rsquo;it you back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not &rsquo;alf, &rsquo;e didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went &rsquo;ome in a cab,&rdquo; succinctly supplied
Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>Again silence prevailed in Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s snug back
parlour.&nbsp; Mr. Tridge, sitting respectfully upright in his
seat, once more fixed a forlorn and rather anxious gaze on his
host.&nbsp; The late cook to the &ldquo;Jane Gladys,&rdquo;
untroubled by his old shipmate&rsquo;s appealing visage, settled
down more comfortably in his arm-chair and puffed in cosy
rumination at the stump of a cigar.&nbsp; A clock, acquired by
Mr. Dobb in the course of business, stood on the
mantelshelf.&nbsp; From the facts that it had just struck eleven
and that its dial registered a quarter to two, anyone thoroughly
familiar with its idiosyncrasies <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>would have deduced that the correct
hour of the evening was something between six and seven.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, presently producing a penknife, impaled his
cigar-stump on the point of its blade and thus pursued his smoke
to its exceedingly bitter end.&nbsp; Still he forbore from
speech, and at last Mr. Tridge, with a deep sigh of regret, rose
to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I may as well be going now,&rdquo; he asserted,
mournfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-night, &rsquo;Orace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He crossed to the door, and there he halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I was you,&rdquo; he announced, bitterly,
&ldquo;I should swaller the rest of that there seegar!&nbsp; You
won&rsquo;t lose none of it, then.&nbsp; And, besides, it
can&rsquo;t taste worse than it smells!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, in no wise irritated by this little ebullience of
feeling, smiled up pleasantly at his visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your &rsquo;urry?&rdquo; asked
Horace.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come and sit down again!&nbsp; We
&rsquo;aven&rsquo;t finished &rsquo;alf our chat yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With marked readiness Mr. Tridge returned to his chair,
contritely murmuring an apology for his impoliteness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Horace,
handsomely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seegars is never quite right when other
chaps is smoking &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve noticed that
myself.&nbsp; Now, let me see, what were we talking
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About me starting in a little &rsquo;air-dressing
business of me own,&rdquo; replied Mr. Tridge, leaning forward
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>we</i> wasn&rsquo;t talking about that,&rdquo;
corrected Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>You</i> was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve figgered it all out,&rdquo; continued Mr.
Tridge, undeterred, &ldquo;and for twenty quid I could get
going.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;d pay you your money back in
instalments, and pay you interest at the rate
of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t take no hinterest from you,
Joe,&rdquo; observed Mr. Dobb, with a kindly smile, &ldquo;and I
shan&rsquo;t take no hinstalments neither.&nbsp; In fact, I
shan&rsquo;t want no money back from you at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if ever there was a true pal&mdash;&rdquo;
gabbled Mr. Tridge, with the liveliest gratitude.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
always knew it!&nbsp; If ever there was a real friend in
need&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t want no money back from you at all,
Joe,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Dobb, coldly, &ldquo;because I
shan&rsquo;t let you &rsquo;ave none to begin with.&nbsp; I
shouldn&rsquo;t dream of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the mean, &rsquo;ard-&rsquo;earted,
un&rsquo;elpful, false friends&mdash;&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.
Tridge, in high vexation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go into the shop there, Joe,&rdquo; directed Mr.
Dobb, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll see my motter &rsquo;ung up large
on the wall.&nbsp; &lsquo;Strictly
Business!&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s my guiding princerple, and
you knows it!&nbsp; Business is business, and friendship is
friendship, and when you tries to mix &rsquo;em you gets a little
of each and not enough of both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But lending me twenty quid to start on my own with
would be business,&rdquo; contended Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d pay you back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you would,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Dobb,
sceptically.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you could.&nbsp; But s&rsquo;pose
the speckylation turned out a failure, eh?&nbsp; No, Joe, I
ain&rsquo;t going to risk my money, and there&rsquo;s a end to
it.&nbsp; Or, rather, there won&rsquo;t be a end of it.&nbsp; And
now let&rsquo;s change the subject and talk about something
hinteresting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;but,&rdquo; spluttered Mr. Tridge,
wrathfully, &ldquo;it was you what made me lose all my time
learning &rsquo;air-dressing!&nbsp; Cut and cut old Sam
Clark&rsquo;s &rsquo;air, I did, till it looked as if &rsquo;is
&rsquo;ead &rsquo;ad been varnished!&nbsp; Practised clean
shaving on Peter Lock till &rsquo;is chin was so sore &rsquo;e
&rsquo;ad to grow a beard!&nbsp; It was you that was going <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>to get me
settled as a &rsquo;air-dresser, you remember?&rdquo; he
sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; confessed Mr. Dobb, flushing a
little at the recollection.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, well, mistakes
<i>will</i> &rsquo;appen,&rdquo; he put forward, with an effort
to be casual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistakes <i>did</i> &rsquo;appen,&rdquo; amended Mr.
Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;And &rsquo;ere am I with the old &lsquo;Jane
Gladys&rsquo; sold from under me, and me the only one of
&rsquo;er crew out of a job.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Peter Lock in a
snug billet, there&rsquo;s old Sam a-ferrying fit to bust
&rsquo;isself all day, there&rsquo;s you married to a widow and
&rsquo;er second-&rsquo;and shop, and only me left out in the
cold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and I want to see you settled,&rdquo; declared
Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;When the four of us are well spaced about
Shore&rsquo;aven, we&rsquo;ll be able to work some fine deals,
bigger than ever we dreamed of on the old &lsquo;Jane
Gladys.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you &rsquo;elp me to
settle?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Tridge, not unreasonably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Eaven &rsquo;elps them what &rsquo;elps
themselves, don&rsquo;t forget, Joe,&rdquo; was Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s
pious reply.</p>
<p>Impatiently Mr. Tridge rose again to his feet and stalked to
the door.&nbsp; Again Mr. Dobb invited him to return to his seat
and tarry longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say as I won&rsquo;t &rsquo;elp you to
&rsquo;elp yourself, Joe,&rdquo; observed Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In fact, if you only wouldn&rsquo;t be so &rsquo;asty, and
would listen to what I &rsquo;ave to say, you might feel sorry
for all the things you&rsquo;re trying to think of to say about
me as you stands there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tridge, with a demeanor nicely balanced between resentment
and humility, once more sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t forgot &rsquo;ow you&rsquo;re situated,
Joe,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bore
you in mind constant.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you
to come and see me these last few days.&nbsp; I got a little
matter to put before you, <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>Joe, what ought to be good for
twenty quid at least, if you cares to tackle it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you mention it before?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Tridge, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure &rsquo;ow you&rsquo;d
take it,&rdquo; returned Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see,
there&mdash;there&rsquo;s a certain amount of disgrace about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it brings in twenty quid,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge,
frankly, &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t think it disgraceful, whatever it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and there&rsquo;s a certain amount of
suffering,&rdquo; added Mr. Dobb, watching his friend
narrowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once I get me fingers on the twenty quid, I shall soon
stop suffering,&rdquo; asserted Mr. Tridge, cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you remember me asking you just now if
you&rsquo;d ever &rsquo;ad a quarrel with a
prize-fighter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s that
to&mdash;&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere, &rsquo;strewth!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Orace!&rdquo; cried Mr. Tridge, in alarm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
twig your game now!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re wanting me to match
against a prize-fighter!&nbsp; No, thanks!&rdquo; he said, with
the utmost firmness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Once bit, twice shy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit!&rdquo; begged Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
&rsquo;aven&rsquo;t &rsquo;eard what I&rsquo;ve got to
say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t want to, either!&nbsp; Not if
there&rsquo;s a prize fight at the end of it!&nbsp; Not for fifty
blessed quid!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad some!&nbsp; No, thank
you, &rsquo;Orace.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t fighting no prize-fighters
on the thin chance of getting a purse of twenty
quid&mdash;<i>if</i> I win.&nbsp; Not me,
&rsquo;Orace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t &rsquo;ark to what I say!&rdquo;
complained Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; asseverated Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;While I&rsquo;ve got the senses I was born with,
I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave nothing to do with prize-fighters, and
that&rsquo;s flat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it?&rdquo; asked Horace.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your last word?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>&ldquo;I do!&rdquo; returned Mr. Tridge, in complete
determination.&nbsp; &ldquo;It are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb shook his head a little perplexedly, and was clearly
on the point of saying something further, when he changed his
mind and frowned thoughtfully at the ceiling for some
while.&nbsp; Mr. Tridge, with arms doggedly folded, stared at him
in resolute opposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, Joe,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, at
last, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re on quite the wrong tack.&nbsp;
Prize-fighters ain&rsquo;t got nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what did you drag &rsquo;em in for?&rdquo;
countered Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wanted to see if you knew what kind of chaps
prize-fighters was like to get into trouble with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and what did you want to know that for?&rdquo;
queried Mr. Tridge, vigilantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So as to see whether you&rsquo;d realize, by
comparison, what a very different sort of job this is I&rsquo;m
offering you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ave it your own way,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge,
guardedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You go on and say all you&rsquo;ve got to
say, and I&rsquo;ll listen.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ll
promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, Mr. Dobb began to entertain his old shipmate
with a character sketch of a certain Mr. Jevvings, Christian name
either Haugustas or Hadolphus.</p>
<p>But whatever uncertainty Mr. Dobb might have as to Mr.
Jevvings&rsquo; correct baptismal name, he had none as to Mr.
Jevvings&rsquo; character.&nbsp; Mr. Jevvings, testified Horace,
was a sport, a nut, a scorcher, a lad of the village, and a real
caution.&nbsp; Also, it appeared, he was a knockout, a go-er,
and, likewise, a cough-drop.&nbsp; Alternatively, he was also the
limit.&nbsp; Mr. Tridge, nodding his head sapiently over these
titles to fame, epitomized <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>them all in the surmise that Mr.
Jevvings must be a lively sort of card, and this description of
the young gentleman gained Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s cordial
agreement.</p>
<p>Blessed with a gay disposition, an abundance of cash, and a
widespread reputation for boisterous exploits, one might have
expected that Mr. Jevvings found life replete with
satisfaction.&nbsp; But, no! said Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; Oh, dear,
no!&nbsp; There was something which inexorably qualified Mr.
Jevvings&rsquo; enjoyment of existence.&nbsp; As Mr. Dobb phrased
it, there was always a wasp in Mr. Jevvings&rsquo; jam.</p>
<p>It seemed that that young gentleman, although of average
build, sadly lacked physical prowess, so much so that, in some of
his roystering adventures, antagonists had thought nothing of
playfully ruffling his hair prior to throwing him through a
window.&nbsp; Courage in plenty had Mr. Jevvings, else would he
long ago have retired into obscurity, but he had no skill at
arms, and very frequently this precipitated an anticlimax in his
spirited doings, so that they ended unheroically for him.&nbsp;
Too often, in fact, had this happened of late, and consequently
Mr. Jevvings&rsquo; reputation as a dashing blade was beginning
to be clouded by a certain ribald contempt for his
activities.</p>
<p>These things did Mr. Dobb explain to Mr. Tridge, in the terms
most easily understanded of his old shipmate.&nbsp; Arrived at
this point, he leaned impressively forward and tapped Mr. Tridge
on the knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; stated Mr. Dobb,
&ldquo;&rsquo;e&rsquo;s got a idea for making people like
&rsquo;im more serious.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s going to &rsquo;ave a
fight with some one and knock &rsquo;im clean out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But from what you&rsquo;ve been telling me,&rdquo;
objected Mr. Tridge, &ldquo;&rsquo;e couldn&rsquo;t knock a fly
off the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>Mr.
Dobb, sitting erect, favoured his friend with a vast lingering
wink.&nbsp; Then he continued his exposition.</p>
<p>It appeared that Mr. Jevvings was a close acquaintance of Mr.
Dobb&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Recently he had come unostentatiously to Mr.
Dobb and had confessed to him the bitterness that was vexing his
soul.&nbsp; It was, in fact, Mr. Dobb who had suggested a
semi-public demonstration of his fistic powers which should
compel admiration and respect.&nbsp; With this proposition Mr.
Jevvings had fallen in so enthusiastically that he had left all
arrangements, financial and otherwise, to be consummated by Mr.
Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s where <i>you</i> comes in,&rdquo;
explained Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge, acutely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
says something to &rsquo;im, &rsquo;e knocks me down, and I get
twenty quid for it?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not so helementary as that, Joe!&rdquo; replied Mr.
Dobb, pained at such lack of artistic imagination.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be worked up to, neat and natural.&nbsp;
And there&rsquo;s got to be time for people to talk about it,
before it comes off, as well as after.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be a
swell thing, fought out reg&rsquo;lar in a boxing-ring, with
seconds and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when &rsquo;e&rsquo;s knocked me about long
enough,&rdquo; supposed Mr. Tridge, &ldquo;down I goes, and takes
the count-out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roughly, agreed Mr. Dobb, that was about the size of it.&nbsp;
But the preliminaries, he pointed out, would need careful
handling to create sufficient stir to satisfy Mr. Jevvings, and
also Mr. Tridge would be required to take enough punishment to
make the affair look convincing ere he succumbed to Mr.
Jevvings&rsquo; knockout blow.&nbsp; This, he explained, was the
voluntary humiliation and suffering to which he had alluded
earlier in the evening.</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>&ldquo;Well, if &rsquo;e&rsquo;s &rsquo;alf the rabbit
you make &rsquo;im out to be, &rsquo;e can&rsquo;t &rsquo;urt me
much,&rdquo; complacently theorized Mr. Tridge; &ldquo;and, as
for &rsquo;umiliation, I&rsquo;ve been &rsquo;umiliated for
nothing at all in police-courts before now, so I certainly
don&rsquo;t mind being &rsquo;umiliated for money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, warmly eulogizing Mr. Tridge&rsquo;s philosophy,
assured him that the money was safe enough.&nbsp; Once
arrangements were in trim for the combat, he&mdash;Mr.
Dobb&mdash;would hold himself personally responsible for its
payment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll set the ball rolling this very
night,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, with a computative glance at the
clock. &ldquo;Jevvings&rsquo;ll be up in the &lsquo;Rose and
Crown,&rsquo; along of some of &rsquo;is pals.&nbsp; You must
manage to get into a haltercation with &rsquo;im straightway, and
leave the rest to me and one or two others what are in the
know.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll see that a boxing match is fixed up
between you, and you can leave all the arrangements to
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To all this Mr. Tridge assented with perfect readiness.&nbsp;
Mr. Dobb then added a few simple instructions, and, after a
single rehearsal, pronounced Mr. Tridge perfect in his
role.&nbsp; Summoning his wife from some remote apartment, Mr.
Dobb affably slipped his arm through Mr. Tridge&rsquo;s, and the
pair set off for the &ldquo;Rose and Crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &rsquo;im&mdash;that&rsquo;s
Jevvings!&rdquo; whispered Horace, as they entered the crowded
saloon bar.&nbsp; &ldquo;That quiet-looking young feller in the
check suit, with the pink tie, sitting reading the noospaper with
patent leather boots on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tridge, with a nod of comprehension, began to cross the
floor.&nbsp; He was in the act of passing the young man when he
stumbled clumsily, and, to preserve his <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>balance,
first knocked off the young man&rsquo;s hat and next ripped the
newspaper from his grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you keep your great feet out of the
way?&rdquo; bellowed Mr. Tridge, furiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
ought to sit with &rsquo;em sticking out of the window, the size
they are!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t want patent leather on
&rsquo;em&mdash;you wants red lamps on &rsquo;em and a
watchman&rsquo;s box by the side of &rsquo;em!&nbsp; Of all the
awkward&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jevvings, while preserving his calm under this onslaught,
rose from his seat with a singularly sinister expression.&nbsp;
Then, catching the expressive face of Mr. Dobb, he sat down
again, a little helplessly.&nbsp; An awed hush had fallen on the
room; frequenters of the apartment carefully setting down their
glasses stared incredulously at the truculent Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must ask you to apologize!&rdquo; said the aggrieved
Mr. Jevvings, in a somewhat fluty voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask away!&rdquo; returned Mr. Tridge, with jocund
ferocity.&nbsp; &ldquo;You keep on till you&rsquo;re as black in
the face as your blessed great boots!&nbsp; Apologize to a
splay-footed whipper-snapper like you?&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;d
sooner give you a smack in the eye!&nbsp; Far sooner!&nbsp; And
so I would, too, for two pins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sort of stifling surprise agitated the room and those
gentlemen who were in the forefront of the quarrel cautiously
stood back, while those on the outer rim of the altercation
craned eagerly forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t apologize,&rdquo; said Mr. Jevvings,
firmly, &ldquo;I shall thrash you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, yus, <i>hin</i>-deed!&rdquo; derided Mr.
Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on, then!&rdquo; he invited, and posed
himself combatantly.</p>
<p>Audible was the rustle of amazement that coursed through the
spectators.&nbsp; Mr. Jevvings, rising, began to turn back his
coat-cuffs.&nbsp; There was a tense hush.</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>And
then, as the folds of a curtain may come sweeping down to suspend
the action of a play, so did Mr. Horace Dobb and the landlord of
the &ldquo;Rose and Crown&rdquo; effectively intervene at this
juncture.</p>
<p>With a deft certainty of grasp, Mr. Dobb and the landlord took
command of affairs.&nbsp; Smoothly and swiftly did they
regularize the situation.&nbsp; Building from the foundation that
a mere rough-and-ready scrap was unthinkable in the chaste
altitudes of the &ldquo;Rose and Crown&rsquo;s&rdquo; saloon bar,
a scaffolding of suggestions was run up with a celerity which
suggested previous consultations, and presently, within this
scaffolding, the outlines took shape of a pugilistic encounter of
considerable ceremony, involving a ring, judge, seconds, and all
the other paraphernalia of the craft.</p>
<p>Mr. Tridge, listening interestedly, heard the arrangements
brought to a conclusion with the fixing of a date at that day
week for the encounter.&nbsp; Mr. Jevvings having signified his
entire willingness to accept the terms of the contest, Mr. Tridge
gave his own acquiescence to the programme, adding rather
gratuitously that, on the Sunday afternoon following the contest
he would call round at the hospital with a bunch of grapes for
Mr. Jevvings.&nbsp; Alternately he proposed to send a handsome
wreath of white flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, then&mdash;that&rsquo;s all
settled!&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, exchanging a glance of relief with
the landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now, Joe, I think we&rsquo;d
better leave &rsquo;ere.&nbsp; Hettiquette, you know,
hettiquettte!&nbsp; &rsquo;E was &rsquo;ere first, and it&rsquo;s
&rsquo;is privilege to remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed in some anxiety to remove Mr. Tridge from the scene,
and, taking him by the arm, drew him to the door.&nbsp; Here he
led the way out into the street.&nbsp; Mr. Tridge, with a
farewell remark to the effect that <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>his opponent would be well advised
to catch measles before the week was out, was about to follow Mr.
Dobb, when a stout gentleman solemnly stepped forward to pat his
shoulder with approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admire your pluck,&rdquo; stated the stout
gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Tridge, glancing scornfully
at Mr. Jevvings.&nbsp; &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t need much
pluck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know who he is, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked
the other, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know and don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; was Mr.
Tridge&rsquo;s reckless reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall expect to
learn &rsquo;oo &rsquo;e is at the inquest, any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know who he is?&rdquo; gasped the stout
gentleman, and then he patted Mr. Tridge&rsquo;s shoulder again,
but this time it was commiseratingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
that&rsquo;s Ted Burch&mdash;<i>you</i> know, <i>the</i> Ted
Burch!&nbsp; &lsquo;Toff&rsquo; Burch, the Swindon
Slogger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; squealed Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A&mdash;a&mdash;a prize-fighter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Middleweight champion of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but I thought &rsquo;is name was
Jevvings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is, <i>pro tem.</i>,&rdquo; returned his
informant.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s stopping here <i>nem.
con.</i>, doing a little quiet training for a match he&rsquo;s
got next month against Billy Traske, of Birmingham,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tridge did not await further instruction concerning Mr.
Edward Burch.&nbsp; He had passed through the door with extreme
celerity and was already cantering passionately in pursuit of Mr.
Horace Dobb.&nbsp; Speedily catching up with his quarry, Mr.
Tridge seized him and charged him with the blackest of treachery
towards an unsuspecting friend.&nbsp; Mr. Dobb, but slightly
stirred by the accusation, obliquely admitted <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>its truth
by regretting that Mr. Tridge should so soon have learnt the
truth about Mr. Burch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but what did you want to play me a trick like
that <i>for</i>?&rdquo; roared Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, because you&rsquo;d never else &rsquo;ave dared to
do what you did,&rdquo; calmly replied Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
said yourself you&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave nothing whatever to do with
prize-fighters.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I &rsquo;ad to take all
the trouble to make up all that yarn I told you about Jevvings
being a wild young chap of this town.&nbsp; Otherwise I&rsquo;d
never have brought you up to the scratch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;m going any
further with it, do you?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>No</i> fear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you can&rsquo;t back out now, Joe!&rdquo;
argued Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;It &rsquo;ud look so silly and
cowardly if you backed out now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care &rsquo;ow it <i>looks</i> if I back
out!&nbsp; I know &rsquo;ow it will <i>feel</i> if I
<i>don&rsquo;t</i> back out, anyway!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think
what possessed you to play such a silly trick on me!&nbsp;
Getting me to agree to stand up to a professional boxer under
false pretences!&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ve half a
mind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, beseeching Mr. Tridge to maintain calm, now promised
to impart the exact truth of the matter, prefacing his statement
with a catalogue of grisly things which he said he hoped would
happen to him if he diverged from complete veracity by as much as
a hair-breadth.</p>
<p>He admitted that Mr. Burch, otherwise Mr. Jevvings, was a
pugilist of some prominence with a deserved fame for neat and
businesslike finishes to his bouts.&nbsp; It was, it transpired,
the aim and ideal of Mr. Burch to put a similarly neat and
businesslike finish to his forthcoming encounter with Mr. William
Traske, of <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>Birmingham.&nbsp; And, indeed, there was not the
slightest doubt of Mr. Burch&rsquo;s ability to do so.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, there were others who held the same confidence as
to the result, and this materially affected the betting on the
issue of the match.&nbsp; In short, so overwhelmingly was Mr.
Burch the favourite that it had become a matter of extreme
difficulty to find anyone willing to bet against him, no matter
how tempting the odds.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, it was thought expedient that
something should transpire to lessen the popularity of Mr. Burch
in betting circles.&nbsp; The landlord of the &ldquo;Rose and
Crown,&rdquo; a party vested with considerable financial
interests in Mr. Burch, had talked the matter over with other
supporters, and together they had agreed on a plan.&nbsp;
Further, the landlord of the &ldquo;Rose and Crown,&rdquo; being
a close friend of Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s and conversant with his
abilities for organization, had called him in counsel and
enlisted his services in the matter.</p>
<p>Briefly the scheme was this.&nbsp; Mr. Burch was to become
involved in a quarrel with a local nobody, and to agree to settle
the difference with boxing-gloves.&nbsp; Mr. Burch was to perform
but indifferently at this match, failing to make the most of
opportunities, and not getting in the knock-out blow till the
twentieth round.&nbsp; There were spies in the Burch camp, and
this strange remissness of his would indubitably be reported
leading to a resurgence of confidence among the supporters of Mr.
Traske, and so creating a profitable reaction on the betting
market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll twig it&rsquo;s a put-up job,&rdquo;
contended Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they won&rsquo;t, not them!&nbsp; You see, the
affair&rsquo;s supposed to be kept very quiet.&nbsp; Of course,
it&rsquo;s really a matter of hadvertisement, to hadvertise that
Burch <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>&rsquo;as gone dead off form; but seeing that
it&rsquo;s a personal matter &rsquo;e&rsquo;s fighting about,
they&rsquo;ll never dream &rsquo;e ain&rsquo;t in
earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, then, concluded Mr. Dobb, was the real office that Mr.
Tridge was required to fill, and the only difference in it to
that which he had aforetime imagined it to be was that he was
expected to stand up to a professional boxer of proved ability,
instead of a mere amateur of indifferent skill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fighting part&rsquo;s just the same,&rdquo; pointed
out Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve only got to let &rsquo;im
play about with you for a bit, and the twenty quid is
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Play about</i>?&rdquo; echoed Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, Joe,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb,
reassuringly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you get twenty quid for it.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a big sum, but I know we can rely on you to keep your
mouth shut.&nbsp; And &rsquo;ere&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Jolly
Sailors&rsquo;&mdash;let&rsquo;s turn in and talk it over
quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This they proceeded to do, though, as time progressed, they
talked less and less quietly.&nbsp; Mr. Dobb, after drawing over
and over again an agreeable mental picture wherein Mr. Tridge,
for a few paltry taps on the nose, was rewarded with a
hair-dressing business of his very own, at length won the
admission from his friend that it seemed worth it, after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course it is,&rdquo; affirmed Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You can take a bit of punishment, can&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can <i>take</i> it all right,&rdquo; acquiesced Mr.
Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;The worst of it is that I always takes it
faster than I gives it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, Joe, &rsquo;e won&rsquo;t &rsquo;it you very
&rsquo;ard,&rdquo; wheedled Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s got to give the idea that &rsquo;e&rsquo;s out
of form.&nbsp; And it won&rsquo;t be till the twentieth round <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>that
&rsquo;e knocks you out, so you&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave plenty of
time to get used to the idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I might go down of my own haccord in the
nineteenth,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge, brightly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
&rsquo;e won&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave a chance to put me properly to
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that, when at length the law of the land compelled the
&ldquo;Jolly Sailors&rdquo; to be churlish with its hospitality,
Mr. Tridge had promised that no effort should be lacking on his
part to crown the match with success, and he and his old shipmate
parted on the best of terms.</p>
<p>Next morning, however, Mr. Tridge&rsquo;s courage had suffered
a relapse.&nbsp; Calling on Mr. Dobb at an early hour, he
proclaimed his intention to abjure the match.&nbsp; In vain did
Mr. Dobb fawn upon him with honeyed words; in vain did Mr. Dobb
conjure up for him a splendid vision of a barber&rsquo;s shop
with &ldquo;J. Tridge&rdquo; in big letters over the door.&nbsp;
Mr. Tridge was obdurate to mere verbal blandishments.&nbsp; It
was only when Mr. Dobb, in desperation, offered to come with him
and enter into pourparlers for early occupation of the little
shop Mr. Tridge knew to be standing empty, that that unwilling
gladiator again agreed to hold to the terms of his contract.</p>
<p>And even then he managed things with so adroit a reluctance
that, before the day was over, Mr. Dobb, to clinch matters more
effectually, was jockeyed into standing surety for the rent of
the little shop, so that Mr. Tridge could enter into tenancy
straightway.</p>
<p>For the next twenty-four hours Mr. Tridge was occupied with
pails and brooms, getting his establishment into order, to the
exclusion of all thoughts about the impending combat.&nbsp; That
night, however, he was too tired to sleep, and next morning he
again sought out <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>Mr. Dobb to place his resignation in his hands.&nbsp;
But Mr. Dobb treated the crisis diplomatically by advancing him
the wherewithal to purchase sundry implements of the
hair-dressing profession.&nbsp; And, after that, Mr. Tridge could
not but vow that he would cause no further concern of mind, and
this promise he loyally kept.</p>
<p>None the less a marked moodiness of manner overcame him as the
day of the encounter drew near, and often his deportment was that
of a man doomed to early disintegration.&nbsp; To cheer him, Mr.
Dobb contrived for him a secret meeting with Mr. Burch, who
revealed himself as quite an amiable young gentleman, and
promised Mr. Tridge that he should receive no real hurt until the
final blow of the contest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; interpolated Mr. Dobb, encouragingly,
&ldquo;you won&rsquo;t be in your senses to feel, Joe, for more
than a millionth part of a second, so you needn&rsquo;t worry
about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so we come to the day of the meeting, with Mr. Tridge, now
visibly a prey to the direst forebodings, and with but a pathetic
interest in his hairdressing shop, ready for immediate
opening.&nbsp; For hours Mr. Tridge had gazed round the tiny
place, sighing profoundly, as one who has achieved an aim too
late in life, or else he had fondled the shining new implements
reverently, as if already they were relics.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb did his best to dissipate these mournful fears,
reporting to Mr. Tridge that his financial share in the affair
was abundantly secure, and that as soon after the conclusion of
the contest as Mr. Tridge was able to think clearly, the landlord
of the &ldquo;Rose and Crown&rdquo; was empowered to pay out to
Mr. Tridge twenty pounds, less the amount already advanced by Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; And also Horace had endeavoured to stimulate Mr.
Tridge&rsquo;s <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>interest in life by causing to be affixed to the wall
of the place of meeting a huge poster which announced the
imminent opening of the Magnolia Toilet Saloon (proprietor, J.
Tridge), Bridge Street, Shorehaven.&nbsp; At six o&rsquo;clock
that evening Mr. Tridge was disturbed in a singularly vain effort
to secure a little refreshing slumber, and was called upon to
receive Mr. Peter Lock.&nbsp; Mr. Lock, at the earnest request of
his old shipmate, had consented to act as Mr. Tridge&rsquo;s
second, and by way of inculcating the proper bright spirit in his
principal with a little facetiousness, he now entered the
apartment with slow, measured tread, and with extraordinary
gravity of mien.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph Tridge,&rdquo; announced Mr. Lock, sepulchrally,
&ldquo;your hour is come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go making a mock of sacred things!&rdquo;
irritably requested Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t
funny&mdash;not at this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph Tridge,&rdquo; droned on Mr. Lock, undeterred,
in the same hollow tones, &ldquo;have you made your
will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It so &rsquo;appens,&rdquo; snapped Mr. Tridge,
&ldquo;I &rsquo;ave!&nbsp; This very hafternoon!&nbsp; Thanks be
I ain&rsquo;t left nothing to grinning i-i-enas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lock, perceiving that Mr. Tridge&rsquo;s nerves were not
yet keyed to appreciation of personal badinage, now endeavoured
to rally him by narrating to him a number of droll anecdotes, all
of which Mr. Tridge received in stony silence.&nbsp; Mr. Lock was
still indefatigably endeavouring to cheer his principal when the
stout and venerable Mr. Samuel Clark made his appearance.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark essayed no levity of conversation.&nbsp; On the
contrary, he crossed in silence to Mr. Tridge and gravely clasped
his hand.&nbsp; This done, he patted Mr. <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>Tridge on
the shoulder with deep sympathy, shook his hand again, and then
sat down with a long, deep sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheerful, <i>you</i> are!&rdquo; growled Mr.
Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;ve come
to&mdash;a fooneral?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; not yet&mdash;not yet, Joe!&rdquo; Mr. Clark
made haste to reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I must say I &rsquo;ad a
most hextryordinary dream about you to-day.&nbsp; Most
hextryordinary!&nbsp; I dreamed you was killed in this &rsquo;ere
fight.&nbsp; Funny thing I should dream that, wasn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Funny</i>?&rdquo; fulminated Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Lock, &ldquo;dreams
always goes by contraries.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be the other chap
what&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my dream,&rdquo; said Mr. Clark, &ldquo;the other
chap was so overcome by &rsquo;orror that &rsquo;e &rsquo;anged
&rsquo;isself.&nbsp; So there you are&mdash;take your
choice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some moments Mr. Tridge sat apparently considering the
selection.&nbsp; Then suddenly he rose and looked sadly in the
mirror, and next he went slowly round the room, gazing at every
article as though in tender farewell.&nbsp; Finally, shaking his
head, he passed out of the apartment, and, followed by Mr. Clark
and Mr. Lock, made his way to the &ldquo;Rose and
Crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he found Mr. Dobb, who professed keen relief at sight of
him, and forthwith conducted him to a dressing-room attached to
the arena.&nbsp; Mr. Lock now offered to his principal much sage
advice with regard to the coming contest; but Mr. Tridge was too
occupied in his own mournful meditations to give useful heed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;not dressed yet?&rdquo; asked Horace, in
surprise, entering the cubicle presently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
you&rsquo;ll be late!&nbsp; The &rsquo;all&rsquo;s packed to
overflowing, and there&rsquo;s three chaps fell through the
skylight already!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>As
one in a dream Mr. Tridge began to disrobe and, later, to habit
himself in the athletic garb Horace had procured for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, come along!&rdquo; ordered Horace,
impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;And for goodness&rsquo; sake, Joe, stop
your knees from rattling so loud, else the referee won&rsquo;t be
able to &rsquo;ear &rsquo;isself speak!&nbsp; And do try to look
&rsquo;appier!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; confessed Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>And now events marched through a haze to meet Mr.
Tridge.&nbsp; He was aware of being pushed on to a platform by
Mr. Lock&rsquo;s shoulder, of being introduced to a crowded
audience, of being fitted with enormous gloves.&nbsp; He heard
plaudits greet his name, and would automatically have smiled his
acknowledgments had he had the least control over his
features.&nbsp; He saw the graceful, well-knit, frame of his
adversary vividly super-imposed, as it were, on a cloud made up
of seconds and attendants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time!&rdquo; declared an authoritative voice.&nbsp; Mr.
Clark breathed on Mr. Tridge a final cheery but unteetotal wish
for his good luck; Mr. Lock gave him a shove; and he found
himself facing his opponent.&nbsp; He caught a glimpse of the
Magnolia Shaving Saloon advertisement, and he subconsciously
wondered whether a ceremonial black shutter had been included
among the stock and fixtures.</p>
<p>Mr. Jevvings bore down on him, glove outstretched, for the
etiquette of handshaking.&nbsp; As hand met hand, Mr. Jevvings
winked surreptitiously at Mr. Tridge in token of remembrance of
the terms of the secret treaty.&nbsp; A sudden alertness
illumined Mr. Tridge&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>And as Mr. Jevvings carelessly stepped back from the
handshake, Mr. Tridge&rsquo;s left arm shot out, unexpectedly and
violently and accurately.&nbsp; With a terrific <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>impact it
landed squarely on the jaw of the unprepared Mr. Jevvings.</p>
<p>Mr. Jevvings momentarily had the illusion of sailing
skyward.&nbsp; Then he landed on the floor with a resounding
thud.</p>
<p>Mr. Tridge, palpitating almost tearfully &rsquo;twixt fear and
hope, hovered near him; but he lay there inert, and they counted
him out.&nbsp; And so Shorehaven&rsquo;s most sensational
boxing-bout came to an abrupt end at its very start.</p>
<p>Again high emotion wrapped a mist around Mr. Tridge, but now
it was tinged with a roseate hue, for, lo! the fight was over and
he was still alive, and, more wonderful still, uninjured.&nbsp;
This alone he could apprehend with the forefront of his mind, but
remoter regions of his brain took heed that there was cheering
and drinking and speeches; there was abject worship from the
stout Mr. Clark, warm commendation from Mr. Peter Lock.&nbsp;
And, most gratifying of all, there was public presentation of the
residue of the twenty pounds, correct to a penny, and also there
was a collection which a dazed but approving audience supported
to the extent of eleven pounds four and six.</p>
<p>Within an hour Mr. Tridge was being lionized in the
bar-parlour.&nbsp; Men strove for the honour of buying drinks for
him, feeling well repaid if he recognized their existence in
return.&nbsp; Quite plutocratic people vied with each other for
the privilege of speaking deferentially to him, and importantly
bade each other hush when he condescended to voice his opinions
on any subject.&nbsp; For Mr. Tridge had won a battle in record
time against the wildest expectation, and was now a hero and had
raised himself into the ranks of the Temporary Immortals.</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>Mr.
Dobb alone appeared out of sympathy with the popular mood for
acclamation.&nbsp; For some while he sat silently watching Mr.
Tridge among his courtiers.&nbsp; At last, unable to repress his
emotions any longer, he rose and led Mr. Tridge into the
obscurity of the passage outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the dooce did you do it for?&rdquo; irascibly
demanded Horace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a hinspiration,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge,
modestly. &ldquo;Just as the start was called, I looked up and I
see that hadvertisement of my saloon.&nbsp; Somehow it come into
my &rsquo;ead all in a flash what you said about the match being
all a matter of hadvertisement, and a idea come to me that almost
blinded me.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t see why I shouldn&rsquo;t get
the hadvertisement for me and my saloon.&nbsp; I could see
&rsquo;ow everybody &rsquo;ud troop up to be shaved by a chap
what &rsquo;ad knocked out Toff Burch of Swindon.&nbsp; I could
see &rsquo;ow useful my reppytation would be to keep customers in
order when they complained if I cut &rsquo;em.&nbsp; And then I
done it.&nbsp; Almost before I could think &rsquo;ow I was to do
it, I done it.&nbsp; I knew I shouldn&rsquo;t get a better
chance, I knew &rsquo;e wouldn&rsquo;t be troubling at all and
that &rsquo;e wasn&rsquo;t hexpecting me to do anything, and I
done it.&nbsp; And it come off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;ll &rsquo;alf kill you for it later
on,&rdquo; prophesied Mr. Dobb, with malevolent satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, &rsquo;e won&rsquo;t!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
&rsquo;ad a chat with &rsquo;im since &rsquo;e come round.&nbsp;
&rsquo;E was pretty sore about it, &rsquo;e owned, but &rsquo;e
don&rsquo;t so much mind now.&nbsp; For why?&nbsp; Already
they&rsquo;re hoffering three to one against &rsquo;im for
&rsquo;is match with Traske of Birmingham.&nbsp; So
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s quite satisfied, after all.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve
took care to see that I ain&rsquo;t hexpected to meet &rsquo;im
again, because I&rsquo;ve been telling every one I&rsquo;d made a
vow long ago to give up boxing <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>for hever from this night forth, and
they all agrees with me that I couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave made a
better end-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, every one else may be satisfied, but <i>I</i>
ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, a little awkwardly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you for why.&nbsp; Knowing &rsquo;ow
things was planned I&rsquo;d been making a good lot of bets at
long odds on this match&mdash;fourteen pounds in
all&mdash;against you, of course.&nbsp; And, seeing as
you&rsquo;ve upset everything, I reckon it &rsquo;ud only be
friendly and fair, out of your collection and so forth, to make
good a bit of my loss to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come round to-morrow when I open,&rdquo; invited Mr.
Tridge, happily, &ldquo;and you shall be the first customer and
I&rsquo;ll shave you free.&nbsp; There!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to get out of it like that, Joe.&nbsp;
Fair&rsquo;s fair!&nbsp; If you&rsquo;d done what you was
hexpected to I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave made money.&nbsp; As it is,
I&rsquo;ve lost it.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;ve got your collection,
and the rest of your twenty quid, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got a motter, too, &rsquo;Orace,&rdquo;
said Mr. Tridge, softly, turning to the door of the
bar-parlour.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s the same as
yours</i>,&rdquo; he ended, with a grin, as he returned to
adulation.</p>
<h2><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span><i>EPISODE VI</i><br />
&ldquo;ALL&rsquo;S FAIR&mdash;&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The single, succinct phrase, &ldquo;Doings!&rdquo; linked to
an address and an hour, had been passed round among the former
shipmates of that obsolete vessel the &ldquo;Jane Gladys,&rdquo;
and this slogan, acting much after the manner of a Fiery Cross,
had immediately rallied the old confederacy to a ready eagerness
to stand shoulder to shoulder again to take toll of the world by
the exercise of those devious methods at which they were so
expert.</p>
<p>And now here, in the cosy back parlour of the little shop in
Fore Street, was assembled that quartet upon whom long
companionship in the &ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo; had conferred a
sinister brotherhood in ignoble aims and disreputable ambitions;
and though each member had passed into a divergent class of
shore-abiding life, it was plain that they were all still closely
united by a common passion for petty intrigue.</p>
<p>Informal presidency over the meeting was exercised by Mr.
Horace Dobb.&nbsp; At Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s right hand sat the trim
and debonair Mr. Peter Lock.&nbsp; On Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s left was
the corpulent and venerable Mr. Samuel Clark, who, by virtue of
his appointment of ferryman across the mouth of Shorehaven
Harbour, still preserved some remnant of his former nautical
environment.&nbsp; Opposite to Mr. Dobb was Mr. Joseph Tridge,
who had fortuitously laid aside his maritime jersey to wear a
cotton <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>overall in that hairdressing shop which Fate and force
had secured for him.</p>
<p>Despite the stimulating and still undisclosed purpose for
which the assemblage had been convened, the opening stages of the
reunion were largely made up of spaces of vaunting autobiography,
contributed by each of the members in a jostling, ill-disciplined
way, sometimes separately, but usually in a pressing, conflicting
chorus.</p>
<p>Thus Mr. Clark recounted, with great glee, as an example of
his acumen, an anecdote concerning a foreign client who was
unfamiliar both with the British system of coinage and the
current rate of payment for passage on a ferry-boat.&nbsp; Mr.
Tridge, in a similar boastful spirit, rehearsed some of his most
successful retorts to customers who complained of dull razors or
blunt scissors or intrusive lather-brushes.&nbsp; Mr. Dobb, for
his part, supplied glowing accounts of the profits to be derived
from the second-hand business by a man who was neither
unperceptive nor too scrupulously honest and Mr. Lock, not to be
overshadowed, revealed many hitherto unsuspected ways by which a
billiard-marker might add substantially to his income.</p>
<p>And so the time wore on very pleasantly, till at last Mr.
Dobb, looking pointedly at the clock, cleared his throat, and
leaning his folded arms on the table, patently assumed a waiting
attitude.&nbsp; Instantly a hush intervened, and something of an
electric thrill coursed through this old and tried combination of
small adventurers, for the time for consideration of serious
business was come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;ere we are,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, gazing
round on his fellows, &ldquo;all well and truly hestablished in
the town of Shore&rsquo;aven, like we&rsquo;ve always &rsquo;oped
and planned.&nbsp; <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>Sitting round bragging about our cleverness is all very
well, but you know my motter, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Strictly business!&rsquo;&rdquo; supplied Mr.
Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I only wish I &rsquo;ad &rsquo;alf the
friendly pints together it must &rsquo;ave saved you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good motter,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb,
equably.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s saved me a lot of talk, anyway,
when you chaps &rsquo;ave dropped round on the chance of
borrering a bob or two.&nbsp; &lsquo;Strictly
business!&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s got to be the motter for all
of us, from now on.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve only to work together, and
we can make ourselves &rsquo;ated for twenty miles round
Shore&rsquo;aven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We used to be &rsquo;ated for a &rsquo;undred miles
round the poor old &lsquo;Jane Gladys,&rsquo;&rdquo; recalled Mr.
Tridge, regretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Strictly business!&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s got
to be one of our motters,&rdquo; continued Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And the other must be &lsquo;&rsquo;Elp one
another!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I like that!&rdquo; exploded Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And only the day before yesterday you refused to let me
&rsquo;ave a cracked old second-&rsquo;and teapot on
credit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now &rsquo;ere we are, all hassembled for a trial
trip, so to speak,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, blandly ignoring the
interruption.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we work it right, there&rsquo;s a
couple of quid in it for each of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do <i>you</i> take?&rdquo; demanded Mr.
Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take the risk,&rdquo; answered Mr. Dobb, simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, what&rsquo;s the hidea, anyway?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;The boss &rsquo;as only given me one night
off from the saloon, so I can&rsquo;t stop here till to-morrow
while you and Joe gets arguing as to whether you&rsquo;re a miser
or a philanthro-what-is-it!&nbsp; I suppose you&rsquo;ve got some
notion to put before us?&nbsp; You generally have.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>&ldquo;And I &rsquo;ave now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Dobb
assured him.&nbsp; &ldquo;A good &rsquo;un, too!&nbsp; You know
old George Pincott?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chap what&rsquo;s lately started in the second-hand
business in opposition to you?&rdquo; returned Mr. Lock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Aye, I know him.&nbsp; He often drops in at our place for
a game of billiards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know &rsquo;e does,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been taking that into account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know &rsquo;im, too,&rdquo; put in Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;E comes round to me every day for a
shave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I understand,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s doing pretty well for a new-comer,
too, ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;e?&rdquo; queried Mr. Clark, not without
suspicion of relish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too jolly well!&rdquo; declared Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E wouldn&rsquo;t buy my carumgorum studs off of
me, though,&rdquo; mentioned Mr. Clark, as though this were a
circumstance that disproved Mr. Pincott&rsquo;s business
inefficiency.&nbsp; &ldquo;Three chances I give &rsquo;im, too,
to say nothing of leaving &rsquo;em at &rsquo;is shop for four
days for &rsquo;im to make up &rsquo;is mind.&nbsp; &rsquo;E was
out when I left &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;e ain&rsquo;t a fool, not by no
means!&rdquo; observed Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, and now do
you know Mr. Simon Lister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know hof &rsquo;im,&rdquo; volunteered Mr.
Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s that old chap what lives in
the big new &rsquo;ouse along the London road, what used to be
something in the hoil and colour line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the chap,&rdquo; accepted Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;E come into a fortune, unexpected, about a year
ago.&nbsp; &rsquo;E&rsquo;s one of my regular
customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! you don&rsquo;t mean to say a rich old chap like
that drops around with old iron and odd crockery to sell to
you?&rdquo; cried Mr. Tridge, in surprise.</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; corrected Mr. Dobb, a trifle
loftily.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E belongs to the hart section of my
business.&nbsp; He buys off of me; &rsquo;e don&rsquo;t
sell.&nbsp; &rsquo;E buys china and vallyble hornyments and so
forth.&nbsp; A collector, &rsquo;e is, only the better
kind.&nbsp; What they calls a connosher.&nbsp; &rsquo;E only goes
in for good stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;e buys it off of <i>you</i>?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Tridge, incredulous.</p>
<p>Momentarily Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s eye drooped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E don&rsquo;t know so very much about
hart,&rdquo; he observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E goes very largely
by what I tells &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do <i>you</i> know about hart?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Lock, gaping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can do business by making out I knows
things,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, firmly, &ldquo;I <i>knows</i>
&rsquo;em!&nbsp; See?&nbsp; Anyway, I make out I do.&nbsp; And
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s got the money to spare to get a collection
together, and &rsquo;e comes to me to &rsquo;elp &rsquo;im, and I
ain&rsquo;t the man to refuse &rsquo;elp to anyone with
money.&nbsp; Pounds and pounds &rsquo;e&rsquo;s spent with me,
just on my recommendation.&nbsp; I let &rsquo;im think that I
think &rsquo;e knows nearly as much as I do about hart, and
&rsquo;e thinks, therefore, as I wouldn&rsquo;t think of cheating
&rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seems a lot of thinking about it,&rdquo; said Mr.
Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hobby of mine,&rdquo; returned Mr. Dobb,
&ldquo;thinking is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you wouldn&rsquo;t dream of deceiving &rsquo;im,
I&rsquo;ll lay!&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge, ironically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No more would I sell a chap off the &lsquo;Raven&rsquo; a
solid, rolled-gold himitation ring for a quid if I &rsquo;ad
&rsquo;alf a chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;China and brickybacks &rsquo;e&rsquo;s bought off of
me, and a few rare old prints, and some genuine
hoil-paintings,&rdquo; catalogued Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;And some
odds and ends what <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>&rsquo;e calls bigjewrious and virtue.&nbsp;
&rsquo;E&rsquo;s got the money to spend, and &rsquo;e wants to
spend it, and &rsquo;oo am I to stand in the way of a man&rsquo;s
wishes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better than a lottery,&rdquo; said Mr.
Clark, wistfully. &ldquo;And &rsquo;ave you got &rsquo;im all to
yourself, &rsquo;Orace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up to a few days ago,&rdquo; replied Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And that brings me to the matter in &rsquo;and.&nbsp; Old
George Pincott got to &rsquo;ear about this &rsquo;ere Mr.
Lister, and &rsquo;e&rsquo;s trying &rsquo;ard to get &rsquo;is
&rsquo;ooks in &rsquo;im and drag &rsquo;im clean away from
me.&nbsp; After all, I found &rsquo;im first, and so I told
Pincott, but &rsquo;is only answer was that all was fair in love
and war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb paused and sighed at such commercial laxity.&nbsp;
Mr. Tridge feelingly remarked that he did not know how the
principle acted in war, but that sometimes it made things very
awkward so far as love was concerned.&nbsp; He was about to cite
an instance when Mr. Dobb again claimed attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever been in that poky little sweetstuff shop
&rsquo;alf way down Market Lane?&rdquo; he asked, as a general
question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, well, I ain&rsquo;t surprised!&rdquo;
he continued, as heads were shaken negatively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tumble-down, ramshackle little place.&nbsp;
But there&rsquo;s a big hoil-painting &rsquo;anging up against
the end wall, because that&rsquo;s the only place where they can
find room for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a picture?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lock, with
interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Saucy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s supposed to be a bit of
scenery&mdash;scenery in a fog at twilight, by the look of
it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s signed by a chap called Carrotti, and the
old gal what keeps the shop will tell you that it&rsquo;s been in
&rsquo;er family for &rsquo;undreds of years.&nbsp; She
won&rsquo;t sell it, she says, because it&rsquo;s a heirloom in
the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>&ldquo;Sentimental old geezer,&rdquo; commented Mr.
Clark. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sell&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know what
I wouldn&rsquo;t sell if I &rsquo;ad the chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ave you tried to buy it off of &rsquo;er?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t, and I ain&rsquo;t going to,
neither,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
give old George Pincott a chance to buy it and make a big profit
out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; expostulated Mr. Lock, at such
altruism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks,&rdquo; continued Mr. Dobb, imperturbably,
&ldquo;as if it might be one of them there Old Masters.&nbsp; But
it ain&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Not by no means!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve took the
opportunity to examine it pretty thorough, and, though I may not
know much about hart really, I do know enough to know that this
pickcher ain&rsquo;t worth as much as the frame round
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see!&rdquo; declared Mr. Lock, slapping his knee
exultantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You want George Pincott to buy it and
then get stuck with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I wouldn&rsquo;t wish &rsquo;im anything so
unkind as that!&rdquo; denied Mr. Dobb, primly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
want &rsquo;im to buy it and go along to sell it to Mr. Lister at
a good profit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be growing wings and learning the
&rsquo;arp next!&rdquo; foretold Mr. Tridge, in wide-eyed
astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and while &rsquo;e&rsquo;s trying to sell it to
&rsquo;im,&rdquo; purred Mr. Dobb, &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m</i> going
to step in and hexpose it as a fraud!&nbsp; And that ought to get
old Lister away from Pincott and back safe to me and my shop for
ever and ever, oughtn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but how are you going to get Pincott to buy
it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in the first place,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget that Pincott keeps a pretty close eye
on me, and <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>that &rsquo;e generally goes by what I do, seeing
I&rsquo;m quicker at the business than &rsquo;e is.&nbsp; And,
for another thing don&rsquo;t forget that &rsquo;e&rsquo;s a
new-comer to these parts, and don&rsquo;t know that us four was
all shipmates together once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but how&mdash;&rdquo; began Mr. Lock again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s where you chaps comes in,&rdquo;
stated Mr. Dobb, and began to converse in lowered, more earnest
tones with each of his old companions in turn.</p>
<p>It was on the following evening that the squat and not
completely fashionable figure of Mr. George Pincott entered the
billiard-room of the &ldquo;Royal William.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hour
was still early, and Mr. Peter Lock, the marker, was rather
forlornly reading a newspaper in a corner.&nbsp; Considerably did
he brighten at the advent of even so unremunerative a patron as
Mr. Pincott, and willingly did he accept that gentleman&rsquo;s
challenge to play a short game in the interval of waiting for
brisker business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a friend of yours this afternoon, sir,&rdquo;
observed Mr. Lock, casually, after a while.&nbsp; &ldquo;At
least, hardly a friend, but more of an acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mr. Pincott, without much interest.</p>
<p>Mr. Lock squinted along his cue, made a shot, and retrieved
the red ball from a pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dobb, of Fore Street,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>&rsquo;im</i>?&rdquo; said Mr. Pincott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessir, Mr. Dobb,&rdquo; went on Mr. Lock; and was
silent till he had brought another stroke to fruition.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Looking very pleased with himself, he was, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, was Mr. Lister along with him?&rdquo; quickly
asked Mr. Pincott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, he was alone.&nbsp; He must be finding
business very good just at present.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t help
smiling as he walked along, and he stopped and chatted to me as
<a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>affable
as affable.&nbsp; He told me I ought to give up billiard-marking
for picture-dealing.&nbsp; He said there was big money to be made
at it by a chap who keeps his eyes open.&nbsp; It struck me at
the time that it was rather a pity in some ways that he
couldn&rsquo;t keep his mouth shut.&nbsp; Mind you, sir, I think
he&rsquo;d been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lock made a pantomimic gesture indicating the assuagement
of thirst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Mr. Pincott, with a rising
inflexion.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what else did &rsquo;e
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I don&rsquo;t know as I ought to repeat it,
you being a trade rival of his, so to speak,&rdquo; said Mr.
Lock, chalking his cue afresh.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, after all, he
didn&rsquo;t tell me nothing very definite.&nbsp; It
seems&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ceased to speak, transferring his entire attention to the
preliminaries of a stroke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did &rsquo;e tell you?&rdquo; demanded Mr.
Pincott, when Mr. Lock stood erect again with a sigh of relief,
and then began to stride purposefully towards the top of the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, sir?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lock, bending for further
effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dobb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dobb?&nbsp; Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Mr. Lock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, I thought there was just the right exact amount of
&lsquo;side&rsquo; on that one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About this &rsquo;ere Dobb!&rdquo; Mr. Pincott
impatiently reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&nbsp; Well, he didn&rsquo;t tell me so very
much, after all, sir.&nbsp; Only something about being on the
track of a vallyble picture, what was hanging up practically
unbeknown in this very town here, and about him hoping to buy it
cheap before anyone else slipped in and snapped it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pincott,
thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he repeated, still more
thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;e said that, did
&rsquo;e?&nbsp; Did &rsquo;e tell you where the picture
was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, he didn&rsquo;t say no more after that.&nbsp;
He just lit a cigar and walked on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few seconds Mr. Pincott silently contemplated this
goading mental picture of Mr. Dobb prodigally lighting cigars,
plainly an earnest and foretaste of opulence to come.&nbsp; Then
Mr. Pincott turned again to the marker and urged him to strive to
remember every word that had passed in this interview with Mr.
Dobb.</p>
<p>Mr. Lock, obliging, repeated some severe strictures of Mr.
Dobb&rsquo;s with regard to the district council, the state of
the weather, and the badness of the local railway service.&nbsp;
He was unable, however, to add one iota to that which he had
already repeated concerning Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s boasted pictorial
discovery.</p>
<p>In the circumstances it was not surprising that Mr. Lock won
the game with unusual ease, for Mr. Pincott had become heavily
meditative, and in this mood he continued long after he had left
the billiard-table, and it was still on him in a slightly
increased degree when he came down to breakfast next morning.</p>
<p>It was soon after that meal that the bell affixed to the door
of his shop summoned Mr. Pincott to the counter.&nbsp; Standing
near the door, in an attitude somewhat furtive and hesitant, was
a stout and aged mariner whom Mr. Pincott identified as the
propulsive power of the ferry plying across the harbour
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I&mdash;can I speak to you, private and confident,
for a minute, sir?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clark, hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends,&rdquo; hedged Mr. Pincott.</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t nothing to do with carumgorums
this time, sir,&rdquo; promised Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s anything the police might want to know
about,&rdquo; said Mr. Pincott, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve come to the
wrong shop.&nbsp; Come at the wrong time o&rsquo; day,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor it ain&rsquo;t anything to do with lead piping nor
door-knockers, nor anything like that, sir,&rdquo; disclaimed Mr.
Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Clark gazed cautiously about him, and then, articulating
into the back of his hand in a conspiratorial way, whispered
across the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; asked Mr. Pincott.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ear?&nbsp; Carrots?&nbsp; This ain&rsquo;t a
greengrocery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked,&rdquo; said Mr. Clark, more audibly,
&ldquo;&rsquo;ow much is Carrottis worth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carrottis?&rdquo; echoed Mr. Pincott, puzzled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What are they, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pickchers,&rdquo; explained Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sort of these clarrsical pickchers painted by a chap
called Carrotti, ages and ages ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow the dooce should I know?&rdquo; irritably
began Mr. Pincott; and then his professional instincts asserted
themselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&mdash;they might be worth anything,
up or down.&nbsp; It all depends.&nbsp; What makes you
ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a certain party wants to buy one,&rdquo;
said Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;And &rsquo;e&rsquo;s made a offer
for it, and it&rsquo;s been refused.&nbsp; And &rsquo;e&rsquo;s
asked me to go along and make a little &rsquo;igher offer for it
on &rsquo;is behalf and yet not on his behalf, if you takes my
meaning.&nbsp; &rsquo;E&rsquo;s frightened that they know
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s keen on getting it.&nbsp; And I says to myself
that if there&rsquo;s money to be made, why shouldn&rsquo;t I
make a bit extra, too?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s only fair, ain&rsquo;t
it, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; assented Mr. Pincott.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And who might your friend be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that &rsquo;ud be telling,&rdquo; said Mr.
Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I promised to keep &rsquo;is name right
out of it.&nbsp; But,&rdquo; he added, leering artfully,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s only you and &rsquo;im in the same business
in this &rsquo;ere town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Orace Dobb!&rdquo; cried Mr. Pincott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can take my haffydavit that I never told you
&rsquo;is name, now, can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; pointed out Mr. Clark,
primly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, be &rsquo;e &rsquo;oo &rsquo;e may,
why should I take the trouble to buy it for &rsquo;im for a small
tip when some one else might be willing to give me a bigger
one?&nbsp; &rsquo;E ain&rsquo;t got no particular call on me, and
business is business when all&rsquo;s said and done, ain&rsquo;t
it, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; assented Mr. Pincott.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t you be artful as well as anybody
else?&nbsp; Where did you say the pickcher was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; replied Mr. Clark,
gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;ow can I say whether I want to buy it if I
&rsquo;aven&rsquo;t seen it?&rdquo; contended Mr. Pincott,
frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I wasn&rsquo;t born yestiddy!&rdquo; declared Mr.
Clark, acutely.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I tells you where the picture is
to be found I might as well be right out of the affair
altogether.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d go along and buy it on your own,
behind my back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing,&rdquo; denied Mr. Pincott, with overdone
indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I can proteck my own hinterests, thanks
be!&rdquo; stated Mr. Clark, easily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait
till things is a bit further hadvanced before I commits
myself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll find out what price she&rsquo;s willing
to take, and see you again before I sees Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ow will that do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; commended Mr. Pincott.
&ldquo;But&mdash;but I shouldn&rsquo;t waste no time if I was
you.&nbsp; <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>I&rsquo;d go right down there now, wherever it is, and
carry things a step farther without delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I will, this minute,&rdquo; agreed Mr.
Clark.&nbsp; He favoured Mr. Pincott with a vast wink, and nodded
very knowingly at him in token of mutual understanding.&nbsp; He
then took his departure, and Mr. Pincott, giving him a grudged
start of one minute, followed cautiously after him.&nbsp; The
fact that Mr. Clark, without stopping anywhere, made his way
directly back to his employment at the ferry caused Mr. Pincott
to speak of that aged man&rsquo;s duplicity in the harshest
terms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, anyway, I&rsquo;m further than I was last
night!&rdquo; was the consolation Mr. Pincott eventually found
for himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Carrotti, and Dobb&rsquo;s
found it and means to buy it at a bargain, and intends to sell it
to old Lister, no doubt.&nbsp; However, there&rsquo;s nothing to
prevent me selling it to Lister either, if I can get &rsquo;old
of it.&nbsp; Carrotti?&rdquo; he mused.&nbsp; &ldquo;First
I&rsquo;ve ever &rsquo;eard of &rsquo;im, but &rsquo;e
<i>sounds</i> all right.&nbsp; Anyway, if it&rsquo;s good enough
for Dobb, it&rsquo;s good enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with a grin of satisfaction at the prospect of defeating
his sole competitor in the district, Mr. Pincott put on his hat
again, and sauntered along for his customary shave.</p>
<p>He found the Magnolia Toilet Saloon to be void of customers,
and at once sat down in the operating chair.&nbsp; Mr. Tridge,
deftly tucking a towel about his patron&rsquo;s throat, began to
indulge in conversation with professional fluency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;ow&rsquo;s business, sir?&rdquo; he
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pretty bright, I &rsquo;ope?&nbsp; There
seems to be plenty of money knocking about the town for them as
knows where to look for it.&nbsp; I know one gent, a customer of
mine, what reckons to clear easy fifty quid over a little deal
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>got in &rsquo;and, and the funny part of it is that
&rsquo;e ain&rsquo;t bought what &rsquo;e&rsquo;s after
yet.&nbsp; &rsquo;E&rsquo;s made a offer, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly and, obtaining Mr. Pincott&rsquo;s
attention in the mirror, frowned warningly at him as Mr. Dobb
entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Mr. Pincott.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb nodded patronizingly to Mr. Tridge, and accorded a
rather more patronizing nod to Mr. Pincott.&nbsp; He then sat
down quietly with a newspaper to await his turn for Mr.
Tridge&rsquo;s services.&nbsp; This coming at last, he took his
place in the chair with marked alacrity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep me longer than you can
&rsquo;elp,&rdquo; he directed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit
later than I meant to be already.&nbsp; Give me a nice, clean
shave, will you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m just on my way to see a lady on
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pincott, in the act of passing through the doorway,
involuntarily turned round and stared at Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>When, ten minutes later, Mr. Dobb emerged from Mr.
Tridge&rsquo;s establishment, lovingly caressing and pinching a
velvet chin, he betrayed not the slightest indication that he was
aware that Mr. Pincott was lurking inconspicuously at an adjacent
corner.&nbsp; Mr. Dobb, as one with a definite purpose, walked
sharply up the street, turned into the neighbouring High Street,
and thence crossed the wide market place diagonally.&nbsp; His
itinerary was closely watched and imitated by Mr. Pincott.</p>
<p>And next Mr. Dobb made his way down the narrow, tumble-down
alley known as Market Lane, still vigilantly attended by his
trade rival.&nbsp; Finally, Mr. Dobb halted at a little
sweetstuff shop, and without looking round, entered at its
door.&nbsp; Mr. Pincott, finding convenient ambush near by,
patiently waited for some <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>minutes, and at last saw Mr. Dobb
come again to the threshold of the tiny shop.&nbsp; Here Mr. Dobb
turned round, and seemed to be in earnest discussion with some
one within, eventually going off back along Market Lane with his
hands deep thrust in his pockets and a dissatisfied expression on
his face.</p>
<p>Mr. Pincott elatedly watched Mr. Dobb vanish from sight.&nbsp;
Then, with long, eager strides, he went across the street and
entered the little shop to the symptoms of tempestuous jangling
of its door-bell.&nbsp; A female gazed at him inquiringly from
behind the counter, but Mr. Pincott made no immediate remark to
her, for he was engrossed in staring at a huge and pitchy
landscape.&nbsp; Closer examination revealed the signature of
&ldquo;Andrew Carrotti&rdquo; flung across a corner in a crimson
scrawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very old picture, that,&rdquo; observed the lady behind
the counter, speaking with a kind of heavy and mechanical
civility.&nbsp; &ldquo;Been in our family for years and
years.&nbsp; Not for sale, of course.&nbsp; We only hangs it up
there because there ain&rsquo;t any other room for it.&nbsp; And
what can I get for you, please, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for sale, eh?&rdquo; said Mr. Pincott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; she replied, definitely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another gent just been in and tried
&rsquo;ard to buy it, but I &rsquo;ad to refuse him.&nbsp; Was
you thinking of choc&rsquo;lates, sir?&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got some
just fresh in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of certain negotiations which, despite the lady&rsquo;s
unwillingness, followed so swiftly and with such continuity of
impact, it is superfluous to write.&nbsp; Suffice it to record
that Mr. Pincott, fortified and stimulated by the thought that
here was something he was snatching from the very grasp of Mr.
Dobb, was content to believe that the intrinsic unloveliness of
the picture did not matter, and that its value was not its value
as a <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>work of art, but as a piece of property for which Mr.
Lister would pay handsomely.</p>
<p>So at last the lady, conceded her sex&rsquo;s privilege,
changed her mind, and was at last prevailed upon to part with the
picture at a price which was only satisfactory to Mr. Pincott for
the justification it afforded him to demand profits on the higher
scale from Mr. Simon Lister.</p>
<p>In some excitement and a decrepit cab, Mr. Pincott carted his
purchase direct to that gentleman&rsquo;s abode in the suburbs of
Shorehaven.&nbsp; Mr. Dobb, who had been doing a little
reconnoitring duty in his turn, saw the vehicle turn into the
London road with its burden, and he followed after it on
foot.</p>
<p>Staggering spectacularly beneath his load, Mr. Pincott was
ushered into the presence of Mr. Lister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawks!&rdquo; was Mr. Lister&rsquo;s simple tribute to
the dramatic quality of the occasion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whatever
&rsquo;ave you got there?&rdquo; he asked, somewhat
unnecessarily.&nbsp; &ldquo;A picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pickcher?&rdquo; said Mr. Pincott, setting down the
landscape flat on the table, and mopping his forehead.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be about the finest thing in your
collection.&nbsp; I bought it for you, a rare bargain.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Alf the dealers in the kingdom was after it, but I managed
to diddle &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t very &rsquo;andsome,&rdquo;
mildly criticized the worthy amateur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Andsome?&rdquo; queried Mr. Pincott.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it want to be &rsquo;andsome for?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a genuine Old Master!&nbsp; &rsquo;Undreds of years
old!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been in one family for
generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the kind of thing I want,&rdquo; said
Mr. Lister.&nbsp; &ldquo;And &rsquo;ow did you come to &rsquo;ear
of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad my eye on it for months
past,&rdquo; Mr. Pincott told him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
waiting my opportunity.&nbsp; You know &rsquo;ow it is in our
line.&nbsp; You &rsquo;ave to go slow, otherwise you&rsquo;re
likely to get the price raised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Lister, with a nod of
appreciation for such nice consideration of his pocket.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And &rsquo;oo&rsquo;s it by?&rdquo; he queried, examining
the canvas with enhanced interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andrew Carrotti, the famous Old Master,&rdquo; returned
Mr. Pincott glibly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t need me
to tell you anything more about <i>&rsquo;im</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to &rsquo;ave &rsquo;eard the name
before, though,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Lister, very honestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eard of &rsquo;im and
forgot,&rdquo; returned Mr. Pincott, easily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll look well on that wall there, opposite the
window, won&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ve got any
pickcher-cord &rsquo;andy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t every one that&rsquo;s got a
genuine Old Master hanging on their dining-room wall,&rdquo;
remarked Mr. Lister, with na&iuml;ve pleasure.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Little did I ever dream, when I used to be serving out
&rsquo;alf-pounds of sugar&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you, you&rsquo;re lucky to get it,&rdquo; said Mr.
Pincott. &ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t so himpulsive, I&rsquo;d
&rsquo;ave took it up to London and sold it at Christie&rsquo;s,
but I&rsquo;m content with a small profit, so long as I can keep
your patronage and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to ask me for it?&rdquo; inquired
Mr. Lister, with a belated effort to appear businesslike; and
evinced no more objection than a twinge of surprise when Mr.
Pincott nominated a price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write you out a cheque,&rdquo; promised Mr.
Lister, and this agreeable feat he was in the act of beginning
when the advent of Mr. Horace Dobb was announced.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, proclaiming that he had come specially to bring Mr.
Lister a saucer which matched a cup already <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>in his
collection, betrayed considerable surprise at view of the
picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I do &rsquo;ope you ain&rsquo;t going to
start collecting trash like that, sir?&rdquo; he observed,
reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trash, Mr. Dobb?&rdquo; echoed Mr. Lister.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at a man of your knowledge saying
that!&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you see that it&rsquo;s a genuine Old
Master?&nbsp; Trash, hindeed!&rdquo; he said again,
indignantly.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb bent and scrutinized the landscape closely.&nbsp;
Then he shook his head, and smiled tolerantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pincott&rsquo;s got to learn the business, just as I
&rsquo;ad to,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t a Old
Master, sir, and never was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you take no notice of &rsquo;im,
sir!&rdquo; begged Mr. Pincott.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, &rsquo;e was
after this very pickcher &rsquo;imself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, not me!&rdquo; disclaimed Horace.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I only buys and sells genuine stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is genuine!&rdquo; insisted Mr. Pincott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;s that &rsquo;ere diamond in your
necktie,&rdquo; scoffed Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a Carrotti!&rdquo; cried Mr.
Pincott.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you know &rsquo;ow long ago &rsquo;e
lived, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never
&rsquo;eard of &rsquo;im in all my life before this very
minute.&nbsp; When did &rsquo;e live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Undreds of years ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Undreds of years ago, eh?&rdquo; mused Horace,
looking again at the canvas.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fancy that, now.&nbsp;
But the pickcher&rsquo;s so dirty you can &rsquo;ardly see what
it&rsquo;s meant to be.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got a little bottle of
stuff &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; he went on, producing a small phial full
of a liquid, &ldquo;and if I might clean up just one
corner&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; invited Mr. Lister.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, moistening his handkerchief with a little <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>of the
liquid, worked industriously at a small region on the canvas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; he marvelled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blest if
there ain&rsquo;t another pickcher underneath this &rsquo;ere
one!&nbsp; If the top one is &rsquo;undreds of years old, the
bottom one must be thousands!&nbsp; Why, look!&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere
is a old girl in a crinoline just come to light, and a little bit
of what looks like the Crystal Palace.&nbsp; Must be a view of
the Great Hexibition, or something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clean it up a bit more,&rdquo; said Mr. Lister, in a
new, and strange voice.</p>
<p>Nothing loth, Mr. Dobb renewed his energies over a wider
extent, with such success that presently his theory stood
substantiated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there it is, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, standing
back from his handiwork.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to
say Pincott deliberately tried to cheat you, but when a man
starts in this line of business and knows nothing whatever about
it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb gave a half-pitying shrug of the shoulders.</p>
<p>Five minutes later a husky, indignant and profane Mr. Pincott
had taken his departure, and the discredited picture had gone
with him.&nbsp; Mr. Lister expressed his gratitude to Mr. Dobb in
the warmest terms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite all right, sir,&rdquo; said Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to see no one cheated by
chaps like &rsquo;im, if I can &rsquo;elp it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In future,&rdquo; promised Mr. Lister, &ldquo;I shall
stick by you and abide by your decisions alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after you all right, sir,&rdquo;
returned Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>That same evening, at a convivial little gathering at the
&ldquo;Royal William,&rdquo; Mr. Dobb loyally and uncomplainingly
paid out two pounds to each of his former shipmates.</p>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>&ldquo;A little present from Mr. Pincott,&rdquo; he
observed, flippantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, &rsquo;Orace,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge,
thoughtfully, &ldquo;&rsquo;ow was you so cocksure about the
pickcher being a wrong &rsquo;un?&nbsp; You&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave
looked funny if it &rsquo;ad turned out genuine.&nbsp; After all,
seeing it&rsquo;s been &rsquo;anging up all those years in that
there little shop, and never left the family&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it wasn&rsquo;t genuine,&rdquo; stated Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew jolly well.&nbsp; Matter of fact, I
give that old gal ten bob to &rsquo;ang the pickcher up in
&rsquo;er shop.&nbsp; Matter of fact, it was my property to start
with.&nbsp; See?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span><i>EPISODE VII</i><br />
HIDDEN TREASURE</h2>
<p>Mr. Horace Dobb, concluding his exposition with an emphatic
prophecy of success, settled himself back in his chair, and
smiled round on his old shipmates with a certain high,
patronizing confidence, as a card-player might triumphantly sit
back after spreading an invincible hand on the table for open
inspection.</p>
<p>There followed a short, analytical silence, punctuated towards
its close by crescendo grunts which indicated a widening and
warming comprehension.&nbsp; And next arose an incoherent little
duet, made up of the beginnings of exclamations of admiration
from the lips of Mr. Joseph Tridge and Mr. Peter Lock, while the
tribute of the ancient and corpulent Mr. Samuel Clark took the
flattering form of speechlessness, allied to a slow, marvelling
oscillation of the head and a gaze almost of veneration at Mr.
Dobb.</p>
<p>And then Mr. Joseph Tridge, never a man to restrain honest
sentiments, rose from his chair and forcefully pounded Mr.
Dobb&rsquo;s shoulder in token of esteem for his astuteness, and
at the same time loudly challenged the world to produce Mr.
Dobb&rsquo;s equal either in artfulness or fertility of
invention.&nbsp; And Mr. Peter Lock affectionately declared that
Mr. Dobb, far from being spoiled by life ashore, was now even a
bigger rascal than when he had served as cook to the &ldquo;Jane
Gladys,&rdquo; of mixed memories.</p>
<p><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>These
compliments Mr. Dobb equably accepted as his just due, merely
observing that he counted himself fortunate to have the
co-operation of men who had graduated in craft on that
ill-reputed vessel to assist him now in furthering the more
ambitious plans for which his present occupations as second-hand
dealer offered such scope.&nbsp; As sufficient answer to an
interpolated suggestion of Mr. Tridge&rsquo;s, he reminded them
that &ldquo;Strictly Business&rdquo; was his motto, and explained
that, therefore, he would produce no bottles nor tumblers till it
was manifest that all present thoroughly understood their parts
in the plan of campaign he had outlined to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; said Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Peter Lock&rsquo;s the &rsquo;ero, ain&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the &rsquo;ero,&rdquo; corrected Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The rightful heir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em at the theatre,&rdquo; stated
Mr. Clark, vaguely.&nbsp; &ldquo;With their &rsquo;air all
smarmed down with ile, and being shot at by villains, and
what-not.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s generally a gal or two in the
offing and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Lock, with some
satisfaction, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to be pretty
conspicuous.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that worth, Horace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same to you as to the others,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I&rsquo;ve taken one quid, cost price,
off the sum received, and another one quid for profit, and one
quid more because it&rsquo;s my idea, the rest is divided into
five equal shares and we takes each one, and one over for
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough!&rdquo; accepted Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;All
right.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be the unfortunate young chap
what&rsquo;s lost his great-uncle.&nbsp; What was his name,
Horace?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ennery Pash,&rdquo; supplied Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;You was the happle of his heye,
Peter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loved me like a father he did,&rdquo; stated Mr. Lock.
&ldquo;Always together we was, didn&rsquo;t you say,
Horace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right up to the day before &rsquo;e died so
sudden,&rdquo; instructed Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;And then you
went away on business, and you never come back till weeks after
the melancholy event,&rdquo; he ended, with pride of
artistry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what was he like to look at, Horace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A snuffy, grubby little chap with sandy whiskers and a
bald &rsquo;ead,&rdquo; returned Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t seem exactly the kind of relation to be
proud of,&rdquo; complained Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
you do me better than that, Horace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get misers with top-&rsquo;ats and
white weskits, Peter,&rdquo; pointed out Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If &rsquo;e&rsquo;d spent all &rsquo;is money on clothes,
&rsquo;e wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave &rsquo;ad any to &rsquo;ide in
the seat of &rsquo;is favourite old arm-chair, would
&rsquo;e?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, &rsquo;Orace,&rdquo; put in Mr. Clark,
&ldquo;where did you get the chair to start with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bought it with a odd lot of stuff at a farm sale a few
miles away.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t worth stuffing and
re-up&rsquo;olstering, so I thought I&rsquo;d try to sell it as
it was, and that&rsquo;s &rsquo;ow I come to &rsquo;atch out this
idea I&rsquo;ve been a-telling you of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve &rsquo;it it on just the right chap
in Tommy Lane,&rdquo; approved Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E
drops into my place pretty well every day for a shave, and I
never see such a old idjit for believing what &rsquo;e&rsquo;s
told!&nbsp; You ought to &rsquo;ear some of the adventures of
seafaring life I&rsquo;ve told &rsquo;im!&nbsp; Why, they almost
make <i>me</i> choke, telling <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>&rsquo;em!&nbsp; And yet he&rsquo;d
swallow &rsquo;em down without so much as a cough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Dobb, in some
alarm.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E don&rsquo;t know you and me and
Peter and Sam Clark was all shipmates together once, does
&rsquo;e?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, &rsquo;e don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge,
flushing a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow do you know &rsquo;e don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
demanded Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge, rather reluctantly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always give &rsquo;im to understand that afore
family misfortunes made me take a &rsquo;air-dresser&rsquo;s shop
I was second in command on a torpeder-boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;e believed <i>that</i>?&rdquo; cried Mr.
Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E said that &rsquo;e&rsquo;d guessed it!&nbsp;
Said that there was always something about us naval chaps what
couldn&rsquo;t be disguised, no matter &rsquo;ow &rsquo;ard we
tried!&rdquo; related Mr. Tridge, with pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, we shan&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave no trouble with
<i>&rsquo;im</i>!&rdquo; foretold Mr. Lock, happily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the chap myself; he don&rsquo;t come to
the &lsquo;Royal William&rsquo; billiard-saloon, as I knows
of.&nbsp; Have <i>you</i> ever met him, Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Undreds of times!&rdquo; asserted Mr.
Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;I often ferries &rsquo;im across the
river.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Clark paused, and his eyes twinkled
joyously.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E thinks I used to be a
smack-owner!&rdquo; he crowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever made &rsquo;im think that?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Tridge, in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told &rsquo;im so!&rdquo; shamelessly answered Mr.
Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;A smack-owner!&nbsp; <i>Me</i>!&nbsp; Only I
was unlucky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bit of make-believe I can understand,&rdquo; reproved
Mr. Tridge, loftily.&nbsp; &ldquo;But a pack of downright
<i>lies</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;e shouldn&rsquo;t try to be so clever,
then!&rdquo; said Mr. Clark, with spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
&rsquo;e can slip out the other side without paying my fare,
&rsquo;e think&rsquo;s &rsquo;e&rsquo;s done well, <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>and
&rsquo;e takes a deal of convincing, too, to get the money out of
&rsquo;im in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, &rsquo;e certainly watches money pretty
close,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never yet &rsquo;as
&rsquo;e over-paid me by as much as a &rsquo;apenny, and &rsquo;e
tried to beat down the price of a shave till &rsquo;e see it was
no good.&nbsp; Oh, &rsquo;e&rsquo;s got a eye for the main chance
all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the character I got of &rsquo;im,&rdquo;
mentioned Mr. Dobb, dryly.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Ence this
gathering of old friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; summarized Mr. Lock, &ldquo;this here
Mr. Lane sounds just our mark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that the confederation went into close committee.</p>
<p>It was during the course of the next afternoon that a rotund
little gentleman, with a countenance remarkable for a guileless
expression and neatly trimmed side-whiskers, sauntered down to
the ferry-boat at the mouth of the harbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Mr. Lane, sir!&rdquo; said Mr. Samuel
Clark, with deference.&nbsp; &ldquo;Going across?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little gentleman, affably admitting this to be his
intention, disposed himself neatly in the boat, and Mr. Clark
pulled off at his customary leisurely stroke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful weather!&rdquo; observed Mr. Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just right for heverybody except the doctors, as my old
pal, &rsquo;Ennery Pash, used to say,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Clark,
with some emphasis on the latter portion of his remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely lot of ozone in the air to-day,&rdquo; mentioned
Mr. Lane, sniffing appreciatively at the odours from the
dredger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All, if &rsquo;e could &rsquo;ave got more into
&rsquo;is system, &rsquo;e wouldn&rsquo;t be where &rsquo;e is
to-day,&rdquo; stated Mr. Clark, regretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Lane.</p>
<p><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>&ldquo;My old pal, &rsquo;Ennery Pash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is &rsquo;e now, then?&rdquo; asked the
passenger.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark sorrowfully shook his head and pointed aloft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far as I know,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp; And added:
&ldquo;&rsquo;E was a good churchman, according to &rsquo;is
views, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lane, in response to this sombre intrusion on the
brightness of the day, kept a chastened silence.&nbsp; Mr. Clark,
sighing deeply, shook his head again, and offered a well-known
quotation bearing on the instability of human life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you knew old &rsquo;Ennery Pash,
sir?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I did,&rdquo; returned Mr. Lane,
apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, &rsquo;e was a quiet old chap.&nbsp; &rsquo;E
didn&rsquo;t get about much.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t many as met
&rsquo;im.&nbsp; &rsquo;E stopped indoors most of &rsquo;is time,
only I thought p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you might &rsquo;ave knowed
&rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Where did he live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;e was always moving!&rdquo; replied Mr.
Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E never stopped anywhere long, but now
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s settled for good and all.&nbsp; Five weeks ago,
that was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he buried in the town?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lane,
politely, affecting interest in the sad event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; in Scotland, where &rsquo;e was
born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was &rsquo;e like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, a little, short, shabby old chap, &rsquo;e
was.&nbsp; But, then, there was a reason for &rsquo;is going
shabby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed?&nbsp; He was poor, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>&rsquo;im</i>!&nbsp; &rsquo;E was a
miser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A miser?&rdquo; said Mr. Lane.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really!&nbsp; &rsquo;E told me so &rsquo;isself dozens
of times!&nbsp; &lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; &rsquo;e says to me,
&lsquo;you&rsquo;d never believe &rsquo;ow much I&rsquo;ve got
saved up!&rsquo;&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t bear to spend a penny,
&rsquo;e <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>couldn&rsquo;t; and &rsquo;e kept it all in the
&rsquo;ouse.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t believe in banks, &rsquo;e
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose they found it when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a brass farthing!&rdquo; cheerfully affirmed Mr.
Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange!&nbsp; What did his relations do about
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;d only got one, a great-nephew, and
&rsquo;e was away at the time and couldn&rsquo;t be
found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who paid for the funeral?&nbsp; It must have cost a
lot, taking place in Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of us paid for it, sir, &rsquo;is old pals.&nbsp;
Leastwise, we sold all &rsquo;is furniture and stuff, and raised
the money that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you think became of his savings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you ask <i>me</i>, sir I reckon the old
fool&mdash;begging &rsquo;is pardon, I forgot!&mdash;the poor old
fellow &rsquo;ad kept on changing &rsquo;em into paper money and
&rsquo;ad burned &rsquo;em by accident, or else because &rsquo;e
couldn&rsquo;t bear the idea of anyone else getting &rsquo;em
after &rsquo;e was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought he&rsquo;d have been glad for his
nephew to get them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His great-nephew, sir.&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s as may
be.&nbsp; All I know is that we found a great &rsquo;eap of
charred papers in &rsquo;is fire-place when we broke in, when we
suspected the worst.&nbsp; Lots of it was only old letters and
noos-papers, and so on, but there might easily &rsquo;eve been
paper money amongst it.&nbsp; It was all so powdered up.&nbsp;
Anyway, that&rsquo;s what we decided on in the end, there being
no other way to account for the habsence of the money; and we
&rsquo;adn&rsquo;t &rsquo;alf ransacked &rsquo;is chest of
drawers and boxes, neither!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange!&rdquo; commented Mr. Lane again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Very strange!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we thought, sir,&rdquo; acquiesced Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
<a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Owever, &rsquo;ere we are,&rdquo; he went
on, with an abrupt change of key, as the ferry gently nosed into
the opposite bank.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I never noticed &rsquo;ow
quick we was travelling; all along of chatting about poor old
&rsquo;Ennery Pash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He assisted his passenger to alight, pocketed his fare, and
slowly sculled away again across the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another minute and I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave bust!&rdquo; he
told himself, in rapt enjoyment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sam, my boy,
you&rsquo;re like wine&mdash;you improves with age!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Magnolia Toilet Saloon, Shorehaven, was empty next morning
at noon, save for two individuals.&nbsp; One of these was the
proprietor, Mr. Joseph Tridge; the other was the trim, debonair
Mr. Peter Lock, and to-day he wore a black tie in place of his
usual brilliant neckwear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s sure to be in soon, Peter,&rdquo; Mr.
Tridge was saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is just about &rsquo;is
time.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no good your complaining about
&rsquo;aving to &rsquo;ang about &rsquo;ere.&nbsp; You agreed
with &rsquo;Orace and us others&mdash;&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere quick,
sit down!&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere &rsquo;e comes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lock, casting aside a newspaper, seated himself at a bound
in the operating chair.&nbsp; Mr. Tridge, wrapping a towel about
his companion&rsquo;s shoulders, began delicately to powder Mr.
Lock&rsquo;s smooth chin.&nbsp; A minute later the door opened,
and Mr. Thomas Lane entered with the inquiring, calculating gaze
habitual to men entering barbers&rsquo; shops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t keep you waiting a minute, sir!&rdquo;
called out Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just finishing this
gent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lane sat down readily enough, and Mr. Tridge proceeded to
remove the powder from Mr. Lock&rsquo;s chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;eard nothing more about your
great-uncle&rsquo;s money, sir?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Tridge, in
confidential tones that just reached Mr. Lane&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve pretty well given up hope now,&rdquo;
said Mr. Lock. &ldquo;I begin to think with them others, that he
must have burned it.&nbsp; If ever he had it, mind you!&nbsp;
Perhaps he only talked about it to keep me up to the mark as his
great-nephew.&nbsp; Not that there was any need to do that,
though,&rdquo; declared Mr. Lock, rising, as Mr. Tridge removed
the towel from his shoulder with a professional flourish.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was always very fond of him for his own sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you was, sir,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Tridge,
with sympathy.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t &rsquo;elp thinking
you&rsquo;ve been the victim of bad luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use crying over spilt milk,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock,
philosophically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Still, I&rsquo;d like to have had a
souveneer in memory of him, even if it wasn&rsquo;t money.&nbsp;
But by the time I&rsquo;d got back here, everything had been sold
and the funeral was all over, as you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tridge nodded, and irrelevantly mentioned the sum of
threepence, extending his hand at the same time.&nbsp; A little
light which was shining at the back of his eyes abruptly expired
when Mr. Lock airily told him to put it down on the account, as
usual.</p>
<p>At the departure of Mr. Lock, Mr. Lane took up his position in
the chair, and for some while Mr. Tridge wielded the lather brush
in silence.&nbsp; Frequently did Mr. Tridge glance in the mirror
at his patron, and each time he was pleased to note the
continuance of a meditative look on Mr. Lane&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that young chap you were shaving when I came
in?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lane at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
seem to recognize him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s been about some time,&rdquo; answered
Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the billiard-marker down at
the &lsquo;Royal William.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

153</span>&ldquo;Is his name, by any chance&mdash;er&mdash;what
is it?&mdash;oh, yes!&nbsp; Pash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, his name&rsquo;s Lock, sir&mdash;Peter Lock.&nbsp;
Funny you should have mentioned Pash, though.&nbsp; &rsquo;E was
related to old &rsquo;Ennery Pash.&nbsp; You know, sir, the old
chap they said was a miser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of him,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you, I&rsquo;ve never really swallowed the yarn
that &rsquo;e was a miser,&rdquo; declared Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Only one &rsquo;as to agree with one&rsquo;s customers,
and show an interest in &rsquo;em, you know.&nbsp; But as for old
Pash being a miser&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t like to bet on
it.&nbsp; I know &rsquo;e used to &rsquo;ave a lot of registered
letters come for &rsquo;im, but that don&rsquo;t prove anything,
do it?&nbsp; And as for that tale about &rsquo;im being seen with
stacks of notes as thick as a pack of cards&mdash;well, I never
met anyone as could swear to it, anyway.&nbsp; Besides, they
never found none in &rsquo;is cottage afterwards, though they
searched every &rsquo;ole and corner.&nbsp; Ah, a queer old chap,
&rsquo;e wos!&nbsp; I can see &rsquo;im now, sitting beside
&rsquo;is fire in that old arm-chair of &rsquo;is.&nbsp; &rsquo;E
never stirred from it if &rsquo;e could &rsquo;elp it.&nbsp;
&rsquo;E regular loved that old chair of &rsquo;is.&nbsp; Once
&rsquo;is chimney caught light, and bless me if that chair
wasn&rsquo;t the first thing &rsquo;e thought of to
save!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Mr. Lane, with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And</i> truly,&rdquo; affirmed Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Soon as ever that chimney began to blaze, &rsquo;e lugged
that chair outdoors.&nbsp; Ah, and &rsquo;e wouldn&rsquo;t leave
it, neither, to go in and rescue anything else.&nbsp; &rsquo;E
just sat tight on it there, out in the middle of the road, and
let some one else put out the fire.&nbsp; &rsquo;E said &rsquo;e
wouldn&rsquo;t leave &rsquo;is old chair in case some one stole
it.&nbsp; A shabby, broken old chair like that, fancy!&rdquo;
scornfully concluded Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;No wonder folk
thought &rsquo;im a bit dotty!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>&ldquo;Why, perhaps he&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;
exclaimed.&nbsp; Mr. Lane starting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, sir, or I&rsquo;ll be cutting you,&rdquo;
warned Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps what, you was
a-going to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;perhaps he was very fond of it,&rdquo;
said Mr. Lane, a trifle weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I been a-telling you he was,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
Tridge. &ldquo;But there!&nbsp; Old people like &rsquo;im often
&rsquo;ave queer fancies like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As one dismissing a thoroughly exhausted subject, Mr. Tridge
turned the talk to the doings of Parliament, expounding his views
with no more interruption than an occasional monosyllable
interjected in a preoccupied way by his client.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see, where did you say that young man was
employed?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Lane, when at length Mr. Tridge
simultaneously ceased his political remarks and his tonsorial
services.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What young man, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Mr. Pash&rsquo;s
great-nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, along at the &lsquo;Royal William Hotel,&rsquo;
sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge, turning aside to conceal a satisfied
smile.</p>
<p>It was in the slack hour after tea that same day that the
billiard-room of the &ldquo;Royal William&rdquo; was honoured by
a first visit from Mr. Thomas Lane.&nbsp; He entered coyly,
seating himself just inside the door in the most unobtrusive
manner.&nbsp; Mr. Lock, idly testing his skill at the table,
accorded the visitor a courteous greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want to play, thanks,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Lane. &ldquo;I&mdash;I only just looked in, that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so, sir,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>Mr. Lane offered no further explanation of his presence, and
Mr. Lock walked round the table a few times in leisurely pursuit
of that perfection which comes to <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>practice.&nbsp; The visitor,
watching Mr. Lock&rsquo;s activity through narrowed eyelids,
patiently awaited opportunity, and this Mr. Lock presently
offered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good table, this, sir,&rdquo; he observed,
casually.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good as any you&rsquo;ll find in the
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dare say,&rdquo; returned Mr. Lane, absently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t come across a public table to beat
it,&rdquo; stated Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t
know anything about the private tables in the big houses round
here.&nbsp; I expect there are a few good ones in some of them
big houses on the cliff.&nbsp; If I was a rich man, I&rsquo;d
have a good billiard-table, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Lane, not very brilliantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once I did think that maybe I&rsquo;d have a
billiard-table of my own,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Lock, with a smile
at his own folly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it never come off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lane, alertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was expecting a bit of a legacy,&rdquo; explained Mr.
Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not a big &rsquo;un, mind, but I thought if
there was enough to buy me a billiard-table that &rsquo;ud
satisfy me.&nbsp; It would have kept me in recreation for the
rest of my life.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d got my eye on a place to keep
it, too, and I&rsquo;d have made a bit of money out of it, one
way and another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; prompted Mr. Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t to be,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock, with a
wistful shake of the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how was that?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Lane.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The money was left to some one else, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t no money left at all!&rdquo; Mr.
Lock informed him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just a sort of mystery, it
was.&nbsp; Anyway, they had to sell the furniture to pay for the
funeral, and that tells its own tale, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; murmured Mr. Lane.</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>&ldquo;Not a stick left when I come back on the
scene!&rdquo; related Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to
have had something to remember him by, too.&nbsp; Relation of
mine, you know, he was.&nbsp; &lsquo;Peter,&rsquo; he used to say
to me, &lsquo;Peter, I particular wants you to have my old
arm-chair when I&rsquo;m gone.&rsquo;&nbsp; Always saying that,
he was.&nbsp; Why he couldn&rsquo;t have given it to me while he
was alive, and have done with it, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he didn&rsquo;t want to part with it?&rdquo;
suggested Mr. Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was about it, I expect,&rdquo; agreed Mr.
Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;d certainly got a great fancy for
that chair.&nbsp; Why, he used to carry it into the bedroom with
him at night, and bring it down again in the morning.&nbsp; But,
there, it had clean gone when I got back here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you find out who&rsquo;d bought
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did try, sir, but it was no good.&nbsp; You see, it
was just a sort of Dutch auction, and people paid their money
down for anything they bought, and took it straight away.&nbsp;
There was a lot of strangers present, too, far as I could make
out, and it must have been one of them that bought that old
chair.&nbsp; A chap from the country, some of &rsquo;em told
me.&nbsp; Dare say that old chair&rsquo;s not more than five
miles away at this minute, if the truth was known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you&mdash;haven&rsquo;t you advertised
for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I ain&rsquo;t so keen on it as all that,
sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Lock, carelessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can
remember the old chap well enough, without needing his old
arm-chair to remind me of him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe in
being sentimental, sir, when it costs money, and a advertisement
would cost more than that old chair&rsquo;s worth.&nbsp; Besides,
he won&rsquo;t know now whether I&rsquo;ve got it or not, and, if
he does, it can&rsquo;t make much difference to him, can it,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>With
these practical remarks, Mr. Lock turned again to the
billiard-table for interest.&nbsp; Mr. Lane, after sitting
meditatively for a long three minutes, rose and unostentatiously
quitted the room.</p>
<p>The saloon was well patronized when, a couple of hours later,
Mr. Horace Dobb strolled in.&nbsp; His eyes sought Mr.
Lock&rsquo;s, and, meeting them, a slight upward flicker of the
brows was perceptible.&nbsp; Mr. Lock nodded slowly, once, and
Mr. Dobb drifted out again.</p>
<p>About ten minutes later Mr. Lane, his arms folded and his head
bent in reverie, was occupying his accustomed seat in the
bar-parlour of the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Arms,&rdquo; when a patron
entered with a certain reckless joviality which compelled
attention.&nbsp; Mr. Lane, glancing up petulantly at this
intrusion on his meditations, recognized the new-comer to be a
gentleman who dealt in second-hand goods at an establishment in
Fore Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Evening all!&rdquo; cried Mr. Dobb, exhibiting
an unusual boisterousness of manner.&nbsp; He clung, swaying
gently, to the handle of the door, and beamed owlishly round on
the company.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Evening all&mdash;and be blowed
to the lot of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady behind the counter, with whom it seemed that Mr. Dobb
was something of a favourite, shook her finger at him in
surprised reproach, and asked him what he meant by it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I been keeping off a cold!&rdquo; explained Mr. Dobb,
simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So <i>I</i> should think!&rdquo; declared the lady.</p>
<p>A glassy look came into Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s orbs, indicating
purposeful concentration.&nbsp; Releasing his grasp on the door,
he, as it were, swooped forward and came neatly to rest with his
elbows on the counter.&nbsp; This feat achieved, he gazed about
him as one seeking plaudits.</p>
<p><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>&ldquo;Been keeping off a cold!&rdquo; he announced
again, and performed a little shuffling movement which brought
him backwards to the centre of the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at me
boots!&rdquo; he invited, proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, wherever have you been?&rdquo; asked the
lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;All that mud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I been keeping&mdash;I mean, I been out in the
country!&rdquo; stated Mr. Dobb, returning to the support offered
by the bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been watercressing by the look of it?&rdquo; suggested
the lady, in playful sarcasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business!&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb portentously, and looked
round as though to balk the intentions of eavesdroppers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business!&rdquo; he repeated, in a whisper, and
solemnly put his finger to his lips.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Norraword!&rdquo; he urged warningly, and immediately
added in the loudest, boastfullest accents: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
a good day to-day.&nbsp; Bought a rare lot of stuff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited indecisively a little time, and then, selecting the
chair adjacent to Mr. Lane&rsquo;s, sat down on it with some
abruptness of impact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wanter buy a nice set of fire-irons?&rdquo; he
inquired, winningly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beautiful set!&nbsp;
Bargain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lane replied to the effect that he was adequately
furnished with fire-irons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame you, either!&rdquo; hazily commented
Mr. Dobb, and was silent for a brief space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny thing about it is,&rdquo; he remarked next,
opening one eye to stare at Mr. Lane challengingly,
&ldquo;&rsquo;alf the stuff come from this town to start
with.&nbsp; Now, ain&rsquo;t that a rum &rsquo;un, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; politely ceded Mr. Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is!&rdquo; insisted Mr. Dobb, with
truculence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Me going all the way out there to buy
stuff <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>what &rsquo;ad come&mdash;what &rsquo;ad come from
Shore&rsquo;aven to start with!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a&mdash;a
cohincydence, that&rsquo;s what it is!&nbsp; Going miles and
miles to buy stuff what I could &rsquo;ave bought at old
Pash&rsquo;s sale, if only I&rsquo;d been there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose sale did you say?&rdquo; quickly asked the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind &rsquo;oose sale!&rdquo; returned.&nbsp;
Mr. Dobb, with reserve.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, &rsquo;oosever it was,
the stuff I bought to-day come from it!&nbsp; See?&nbsp; So
don&rsquo;t go a-contradicting of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; protested Mr. Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you was!&rdquo; asserted Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you let a man finish what &rsquo;e&rsquo;s
got to say afore you starts to argue?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m telling you
most of this stuff was bought by a chap in several lots to
furnish &rsquo;is cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said Mr. Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you goes again!&rdquo; complained Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Anyway, &rsquo;e&rsquo;s got a job at the other end of the
country now, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb ceased momentarily, and regarded his boots with a
fond smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t &rsquo;alf been keeping out a
cold!&rdquo; he observed, confidentially.&nbsp; &ldquo;Talk about
mud and rain and cold winds&mdash;&rsquo;oo&rsquo;d live in the
country, I&rsquo;d like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Lane, ingratiatingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who would, indeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Mr. Dobb made no response, being now engaged in inward
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would, indeed?&rdquo; said Mr. Lane again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Dobb, returning to
wakefulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would live in the country?&rdquo; said Mr.
Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, <i>I</i> would!&rdquo; declared Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I love the country!&nbsp; All the little dicky-birds
and&mdash;so on!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>He
suddenly rose, proclaiming his intention of going home to bed as
a preventive measure against chill.&nbsp; He nodded a protracted,
dreary-eyed, good-night to each individual of the company
present, and then, festooning across the apartment, noisily
negotiated the door and passed from view.</p>
<p>No sooner was Mr. Dobb outside in the street, however, than
his waywardness dropped from him, and, congratulating himself on
his histrionic powers, he walked briskly to his abode.</p>
<p>Soon after breakfast next morning, Mr. Lane was visible in
Fore Street.&nbsp; Into half a dozen shop-windows did he peer
with an air of boredom, nor did his expression become quickened
when at length he ranged himself before the jumbled collection of
oddments which Mr. Dobb exhibited to the passer-by.</p>
<p>For some moments Mr. Lane affected a lukewarm interest in a
faded photograph of the Niagara Falls, and next he lingered to
gaze on a teapot which had suffered casualty in its more
obtrusive parts.&nbsp; And, after that, he stepped into the
doorway and pretended close scrutiny of a pair of cast-iron
dumb-bells, and, under cover of this man&oelig;uvre, he glanced
into the interior of the shop, and there saw a heterogeneous pile
of furniture which was evidently awaiting disposal, and the most
conspicuous item in it was a tattered and battered old
arm-chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Lane, involuntarily.</p>
<p>At this juncture Mr. Horace Dobb himself made an appearance at
the threshold of his shop with evident purpose of ascertaining
the state of the weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, sir!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning&mdash;good morning!&rdquo; returned Mr.
Lane, <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>with eager amiability.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you keep the
cold off all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I kept it; but &rsquo;ow did you know I was
trying to keep a cold off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you told me so last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night?&rdquo; queried Mr. Dobb, shaking his
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I never see you last night,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Arms,&rsquo;&rdquo; prompted
Mr. Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never went in the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Arms&rsquo;
last night!&rdquo; denied Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;I came straight
&rsquo;ome and went to bed.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lane was about to contradict, when it was evident that he
changed his intention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I must have been thinking of some one
else,&rdquo; he said, lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;re interested in
furniture, sir,&rdquo; ventured Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;ve got some stuff in new to stock this morning,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind having a look at it,&rdquo; admitted
Mr. Lane, almost skipping into the emporium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bedstead for you!&rdquo; cried the
vendor, with enthusiasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Real solid, good
stuff.&nbsp; Been in a farm&rsquo;ouse these &rsquo;undred years
and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a bedstead,&rdquo; said Mr. Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about a sofa?&rdquo; asked Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>Mr. Lane shook his head.&nbsp; He was giving his attention to
the worn old arm-chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t expect ever to sell a shabby old thing
like that, do you?&rdquo; he asked, artfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a bit knocked about,&rdquo; confessed Mr. Dobb.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a real fine old chair of its kind.&nbsp; I
reckon to get a pretty good price for it when it&rsquo;s been
restored.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave it restuffed and
reup&rsquo;olstered, and it&rsquo;ll fetch a big price, I
lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>&ldquo;It looks very lumpy,&rdquo; observed Mr. Lane,
and seized the opportunity to prod the sagging seat with his
finger.&nbsp; He thrilled electrically when his touch encountered
something vaguely massy and hard in the horsehair stuffing.&nbsp;
Mr. Dobb, who had planned that thrill with the aid of a bulky old
volume from the rubbish corner, winked pleasantly at the
ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;ardly &rsquo;ad a good look at it
yet,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was in with a lot of
other things I was after, though I meant to &rsquo;ave it, of
course, soon as ever I spotted it.&nbsp; Genuine antike, that
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think so!&rdquo; said Mr. Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it belonged to a old chap &rsquo;oo died in
Shore&rsquo;aven &rsquo;ere, and &rsquo;e&rsquo;d &rsquo;ad it
pretty nigh all &rsquo;is life, and chance it!&rdquo; contended
Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder the man who bought it then didn&rsquo;t
overhaul it,&rdquo; mentioned Mr. Lane, thoughtfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps he did?&rdquo; he suggested, a little dashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, &rsquo;e meant to, but &rsquo;e never &rsquo;ad the
time,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E bought it with
that idea, &rsquo;e told me, and &rsquo;e took it to &rsquo;is
cottage in the country, meaning to see to it.&nbsp; But &rsquo;e
&rsquo;append to lose &rsquo;is job, and, what with finding a
fresh one, and then making arrangements to shift &rsquo;is
family, &rsquo;e was so busy that the old chair just stayed up in
&rsquo;is attic, untouched, from the time &rsquo;e took it
&rsquo;ome to the time I bought it yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what would you be asking for it as it
stands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I dunno,&rdquo; mused Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
&rsquo;ud pay me better to touch it up a bit first, I
suppose.&nbsp; A genuine antike, you know.&nbsp; Still, if
anybody was to offer me, say&mdash;oh, fifteen for
it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen shillings!&rdquo; cried Mr. Lane, in
excitement. &ldquo;Right you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>&ldquo;Shillings?&nbsp; No!&rdquo; scornfully
interrupted Mr. Dobb. &ldquo;Pounds, of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s nowhere near worth that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth what it&rsquo;ll fetch,&rdquo; said
Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anyway, by the time I&rsquo;ve pulled it
into shape a bit, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a couple of pounds for it as it
stands,&rdquo; offered Mr. Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that ain&rsquo;t a quarter of what I give for it
myself!&rdquo; returned Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got
a set of fire-irons what you can &rsquo;ave for two quid, if you
like,&rdquo; he offered, brightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want fire-irons,&rdquo; said Mr. Lane,
pettishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t take a penny less than fifteen quid
for that chair.&nbsp; Look at the woodwork!&nbsp; A bit
scratched, maybe, but sound&mdash;sound and &rsquo;eavy.&nbsp;
They don&rsquo;t make &rsquo;em like that nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But fifteen pounds!&rdquo; murmured Mr. Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I shall get more than that for it when I&rsquo;ve
squared it up and restored it,&rdquo; foretold Mr. Dobb,
confidently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I know more than one collector in
these parts that&rsquo;ll only be too anxious to secure it soon
as ever &rsquo;e sees it.&nbsp; In a way, I&rsquo;m doing you a
favour by giving you first chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But fifteen pounds!&rdquo; protested Mr. Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll say twelve as it stands, seeing as I
shan&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave to bother with restoring it.&nbsp; There,
twelve!&nbsp; Just to make a reg&rsquo;lar customer of you, only
don&rsquo;t go talking too much.&nbsp; Why, you can&rsquo;t get
much new in the furniture line to-day for twelve; and as for
antikes&mdash;.&nbsp; Solid, that&rsquo;s what it is!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ere, &rsquo;alf a mo&rsquo;!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll just strip
the cover off and leave the stuffing aside, and you&rsquo;ll see
what a fine strong frame it&rsquo;s got.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t do that&mdash;don&rsquo;t do
that!&rdquo; babbled Mr. Lane, desperately.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&nbsp; I mean, I believe you.&nbsp;
But&mdash;but twelve pounds!&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t mind going
to&mdash;to four, or even five, but&mdash;but twelve!&nbsp; It
isn&rsquo;t a particularly handsome chair&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you seem pretty keen to &rsquo;ave it, sir, for all
that,&rdquo; Mr. Dobb pointed out.&nbsp; &ldquo;However, please
yourself.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t take it I shall put it in my
window there, and somebody&rsquo;s bound to come along
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t let me have it on approval
for a day or two?&rdquo; suggested Mr. Lane, but not
hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp; This is a cash business.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;ll tell you what&mdash;if you like to let me take out the
stuffing and leave it &rsquo;ere, I&rsquo;d knock off a
quid.&nbsp; Good &rsquo;orse&rsquo;air&rsquo;s always
worth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no.&nbsp; I want it as it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then twelve quid buys it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lane again probed the ragged upholstery of the seat with
an investigatory forefinger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you ten,&rdquo; he offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to think I ain&rsquo;t a man of my
word,&rdquo; complained Mr. Dobb, indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten!&rdquo; offered Mr. Lane, again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my limit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later they had arrived at a compromise, and the
sum of eleven pounds ten shillings changed ownership.&nbsp; With
his own hands Mr. Lane lifted the chair and staggered out with it
to the handtruck Mr. Dobb had obligingly placed at his
disposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes with &rsquo;is &rsquo;idden
treasure,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, smiling, as Mr. Lane&rsquo;s
small back bent in energetic propulsion of his purchase.</p>
<p>That same evening Mr. Dobb paid thirty shillings into the
willing grasp of each of his three old <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>shipmates,
and fully endorsed their flattering statements as to his mental
ingenuity.</p>
<p>A fortnight elapsed, and then, one afternoon, Mr. Lane walked
into the emporium.&nbsp; Mr. Dobb, mastering a primitive impulse
to point derisively at his visitor, addressed him in honeyed
tones of courtesy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t seen you lately, sir,&rdquo; he
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been away,&rdquo; said Mr. Lane.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Been taking a bit of a holiday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky to be you, sir, to &rsquo;ave the money to
spare,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I ain&rsquo;t seen
you, come to think of it, not since the morning you bought that
antike chair off of me.&nbsp; I &rsquo;ope you never repented
that antike bargain, sir?&rdquo; he asked, with tremulous
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must say it didn&rsquo;t turn out quite as I
expected,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Lane; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not
grumbling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoke like a sportsman!&rdquo; declared Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny thing, when I took that stuffing to bits,&rdquo;
observed Mr. Lane.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never guess what I
found hidden in the seat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bag o&rsquo; gold!&rdquo; suggested Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; An old book!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; breathed Mr. Dobb, incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact!&rdquo; asseverated Mr. Lane.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Believe me or believe me not, there was a big,
old-fashioned musty old book!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy that!&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surprising, ain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Anyway, I showed it
to a friend of mine, and he said it had evidently been hidden
there because it was very rare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds possible,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, his eyes
watering under the strain of enforced gravity.</p>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>&ldquo;As it happened, my friend was right,&rdquo; said
Mr. Lane.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course, he knew something about old
books, and that was why I showed it to him.&nbsp; Anyway, it was
a rare old first edition, ever so old, and I sent it up to
London, and sold it for thirty guineas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sold it for thirty guineas!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Lane.
&ldquo;Thirty guineas for an old book that anyone who
didn&rsquo;t know its value might have thrown away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; declared Mr. Dobb,
huskily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s the cheque,&rdquo; said Mr. Lane;
&ldquo;and here&rsquo;s the correspondence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb gazed at the documentary evidence.&nbsp; Then,
without a word, he tottered into the shop parlour and took the
unprecedented step of drinking a glass of undiluted water.&nbsp;
The fortunate Mr. Lane, looking round for other chairs to prod
and finding none, went out of the dusty little emporium into the
sunshine.</p>

167</span><i>EPISODE VIII</i><br />
A SPECIAL PERFORMANCE</h2>
<p>Mr. Horace Dobb, released from the ministrations of the
proprietor of the Magnolia Toilet Saloon, critically inspected
the reflection of his shaven chin, and then charged Mr. Joseph
Tridge with being a niggard as to face-powder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere you are!&rdquo; scornfully said Mr. Tridge,
passing him the puff.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Elp yourself!&nbsp; Go
on!&nbsp; Put some on your nose, too.&nbsp; I would, if I was
you!&nbsp; Take some &rsquo;ome with you in a paper bag.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ere, steady!&rdquo; he ended, snatching the puff out of
Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for powdering, not
whitewashing, remember!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t got a little complexion cream to spare,
I suppose?&rdquo; asked Mr. Dobb, unabashed.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I
thought not.&nbsp; Well, then, what about a little drop o&rsquo;
brilliantine, eh?&nbsp; This it?&nbsp; Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be a fool, &rsquo;Orace,&rdquo;
earnestly counselled Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised
at you, I am, reely!&nbsp; Runnin&rsquo; after gals at your time
of life!&nbsp; What would your missis say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t running after no gals,&rdquo; denied Mr.
Dobb. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t even slow-marching after
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; But I wants to look just-so, because I&rsquo;m
making a sort of deboo in &rsquo;igh society this
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fish supper with the dook and duchess, I
suppose?&rdquo; ironically hazarded Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but it&rsquo;s the opening night at the theayter
to-night,&rdquo; explained Mr. Dobb, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going
to sit <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>somewhere near the front seats.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ow&rsquo;s
that for getting on in life, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Free complimentaries,&rdquo; diagnosed Mr. Tridge,
&ldquo;for promising to show window-bills.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ve
got orders for two myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ave you though?&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, a little
dashed by this discounting of his social value.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
I was going to hinvite you to come along with me.&nbsp; We could
&rsquo;ave tossed up to see &rsquo;oo paid for the
programme.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t come, I shall only &rsquo;ave
to take the missis, and I don&rsquo;t want to waste a seat
deliberate like that, if I can &rsquo;elp it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve asked Peter Lock to come along with
me,&rdquo; returned Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s &rsquo;is
night off from the billiard-room.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere, what about
asking old Sam Clark, eh?&nbsp; The four of us going together to
the theayter like we used to do in the good old, bad old days of
the &lsquo;Jane Gladys.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right-o!&rdquo; agreed Mr. Dobb, very readily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Anything to hencourage my missis in &rsquo;ome life.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll all four go together.&nbsp; But no getting chucked
out in a bunch, though, mind,&rdquo; he stipulated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got business reasons for not wanting to upset
the chap what&rsquo;s running the theayter now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a noo management,&rdquo; mentioned Mr.
Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the fifth noo management in
fourteen months, so they tells me.&nbsp; Shore&rsquo;aven
don&rsquo;t seem what you might call a hartistic place, do
it?&nbsp; Specially when they done Shakespeare six weeks
ago.&nbsp; Only done &rsquo;im once, they did, but that was
enough.&nbsp; That was what reely led to the sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sale?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the last time it shut.&nbsp; They &rsquo;ad a sale
of fixtures up there, when the creditors wouldn&rsquo;t take out
<a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>their
money in tickets.&nbsp; That was where the glass shandyleary came
from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shandy-&rsquo;ow-much?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shandyleary.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got it in my shop
now.&nbsp; I bought it off a chap what bought it at the
sale.&nbsp; Great big thing it is, what used to &rsquo;ang in the
centre of the roof.&nbsp; &rsquo;Andsome thing it is, too, in its
way, all made of sparkly bits of glass as big
as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As big as a second-&rsquo;and dealer&rsquo;s Sunday
scarfpin,&rdquo; pointedly suggested Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, pretty nigh,&rdquo; accepted Mr. Dobb, with
complacency.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to sell it back soon to
the chap what&rsquo;s running the theayter now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does &rsquo;e know you&rsquo;re going to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, &rsquo;e don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; admitted Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, &rsquo;e don&rsquo;t even know I&rsquo;ve
got it yet.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve got some one to sound &rsquo;im
to see whether &rsquo;e&rsquo;s at all inclined to buy it, and
&rsquo;e said &rsquo;e won&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave it at no
price.&nbsp; But it takes two to make a quarrel, don&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; Anyway, whether &rsquo;e reely wants it or not,
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s going to buy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;ow are you going to make &rsquo;im do
that?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Tridge, with every faith in his old
shipmate&rsquo;s commercial omnipotence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I ain&rsquo;t thought quite so far as that
yet,&rdquo; confessed Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve fixed
in my mind is that &rsquo;e&rsquo;s going to give me thirty-five
quid for that shandyleary.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s old Joe Bindley, that
retired builder chap, what&rsquo;s the noo proprietor, you
know.&nbsp; &rsquo;E bought up the theayter cheap, as a
speckylation, and &rsquo;e reckons to make a big success out of
it.&nbsp; You ought to &rsquo;ear &rsquo;im talk about what
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s going to do at &rsquo;is theayter!&nbsp; Anyone
might think that the next war was going to be perdooced there as
a front piece to the big play of the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>&ldquo;I see &rsquo;e&rsquo;s starting with a
month&rsquo;s hengagement, straight off, of the world-famous
hactress, Miss Margureety Delafayne,&rdquo; observed Mr. Tridge,
studying a printed announcement on his wall.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Oo&rsquo;s she, anyway?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the first
time I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eard of &rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, she&rsquo;s one of the
good-old-might-&rsquo;ave-been-p&rsquo;r&rsquo;apsers,&rdquo; Mr.
Dobb somewhat ungallantly informed him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not that she
ain&rsquo;t still a fine figure of a woman, far as golden
&rsquo;air and a sealskin coat and light blue satin goes.&nbsp;
But hact?&nbsp; Oh, dear me, no!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more like a fit
of the dismals that hacting.&nbsp; Bindley reckons she&rsquo;s
going to get all the neighbourhood into the reg&rsquo;lar
&rsquo;abit of coming to &rsquo;is theayter.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
more likely to cure &rsquo;em of the &rsquo;abit, to my way of
thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;er, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I paid to see &rsquo;er hact once, at Yarmouth.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve always reckoned I&rsquo;ve been three pints out from
that day to this.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m off now to fix up with
old Sam Clark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meet you outside the show at seven-thirty,&rdquo; said
Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mind you ain&rsquo;t late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never am late,&rdquo; replied Mr. Dobb simply,
&ldquo;when there&rsquo;s something for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus it was ordained, and thus it came about that a few hours
later, four contiguous seats at the Shorehaven Theatre were
occupied by that old-established fellowship of graduates from the
baneful academy of the &ldquo;Jane Gladys.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the
time of their processional entry to the rising of the curtain on
the play, each of the quartet expressed his individuality in his
customary manner.</p>
<p>Mr. Horace Dobb, reflecting very patently the prosperity of
the little shop he had married, leaned back in his seat with an
air of bored patronage and made <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>great play with a ring which, when
happily it caught the light at a certain elusive angle, gleamed
quite visibly.&nbsp; Mr. Joseph Tridge, wearing something new and
very arrestive in the way of check suitings, could not but be
correspondingly sportive and genial in the truculent, domineering
manner.&nbsp; Mr. Peter Lock, trim and brisk and debonair as
ever, maintained a joyous flow of scandal about such of the
attendance present as had their secret histories discussed in the
billiard-room of the &ldquo;Royal William.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the
plump and venerable Mr. Samuel Clark, his rubicund face aglow
with happiness in the reunion, beamed impartially on all around
him, and with a conspicuous, festooning forefinger, beat time to
the orchestra&rsquo;s overture.</p>
<p>But soon after the commencement of the play there developed
changes of temperament, subtle and slight at first, but
broadening progressively as the performance continued.&nbsp; And
thus, before the curtain had descended on the first act, Mr.
Peter Lock&rsquo;s brightness was quite gone, and he was sitting
in a round-shouldered way, with his arms drooping limply down
beside him, while the eyes with which he regarded the stage had
in them nothing but dull resignation.</p>
<p>And Mr. Joseph Tridge was fast asleep, and even snoring a
little, though this was a venial transgression which appeared to
arouse only the emotion of envy among his neighbours.&nbsp; And
Mr. Horace Dobb had ceased to look patronizing, but had retained
an added intensity to his expression of boredom, and had now come
to vehement sighings at frequent intervals.&nbsp; But Mr. Clark
showed no such unfavouring listlessness towards the performance
as his companions were exhibiting.&nbsp; Manifestly to the
contrary, Mr. Clark was craning forward in his seat with so eager
an interest <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>in the drama that he was quite unconscious of the
repressive glances continually directed at him over her shoulder
by the lady whose chair-back he was gripping in his
excitement.&nbsp; His face betokened the raptest concentration of
attention, and several times he had offered audible and emphatic
comment on the goodness of the play, and once he had even stared
round him challengingly to see why no one endorsed his high
opinions.</p>
<p>And when at length the curtain swept down to terminate the
first act, there would have been a complete silence in the
auditorium had not Mr. Clark at once begun to beat his vast palms
together in emphatic approval.&nbsp; A few hirelings of the
management, posted remotely about the building, rather timidly
followed Mr. Clark&rsquo;s lead, and the curtain, after billowing
uncertainly for a while, rose again to reveal Miss Marguerite
Delafayne standing solitary on the stage.&nbsp; In a way that was
not entirely devoid of defiance, Miss Delafayne began to bow her
acknowledgments of the tributes to her art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brayvo!&rdquo; cried Mr. Clark, leaping to his feet and
achieving an almost cyclonic quality in his applause.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Brayvo!&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Delafayne, moved by such warm
partisanship in an otherwise unresponsive world, looked straight
at Mr. Clark and curtseyed in the most queenly manner in his
direction.&nbsp; Mr. Clark, placing his fingers to his lips, was
about to pay the lady still greater homage, when she went on to
bow to a pseudo-enthusiastic programme-seller at the back of the
gallery, and Mr. Clark sat down with a dazed but happy expression
on his face.</p>
<p>The curtain descended again, and immediately a heavy,
discouraged hush enwrapped the theatre.</p>
<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>&ldquo;Well, thank goodness we ain&rsquo;t bought a
programme, anyway!&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, at last breaking
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to buy one now,&rdquo; announced Mr.
Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be an old fool, Sam,&rdquo; urged Mr.
Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave thought anyone
would want to know more about this blessed show than they could
&rsquo;elp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know the&mdash;the scenes and&mdash;and the
names,&rdquo; explained Mr. Clark, hesitantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then borrer a programme, if you must know the
worst,&rdquo; counselled Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I want one to keep,&rdquo; stated Mr. Clark,
shyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To <i>keep</i>?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; observed the perspicacious Mr. Dobb,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re a gay old dorg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see &rsquo;er look at me?&rdquo; demanded Mr.
Clark, in a burst of senile vanity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Straight at
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just as soon be looked at by a sack of
flour!&rdquo; declared Mr. Tridge; and instantly there arose a
quarrel so bitter that, in the interests of peace, Mr. Dobb had
to take the extreme step of curtailing it by offering to pay for
refreshment at some convenient hostelry outside.</p>
<p>Mr. Tridge, closing at once with this invitation, rose to
follow Mr. Dobb from the building, and so did Mr. Lock.&nbsp; Mr.
Clark, however, created a blank amazement by returning an
unprecedented answer to such an offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might be late and miss a bit of the next
hact,&rdquo; he explained; and his companions, after solemnly
shaking their heads at each other for some moments, went silently
away.</p>
<p>They did not return in time for the next act, nor for the next
act after that, though such were Mr. Clark&rsquo;s <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>blissful
preoccupations of mind that he did not notice the defection of
his comrades until he was passing through the lobby at the
conclusion of the performance.&nbsp; And even then he went back
into the auditorium to look for his friends, and was much
mystified by their disappearance.</p>
<p>It was three days later ere Mr. Clark and Mr. Dobb again
met.&nbsp; Mr. Dobb, finding himself near the ferry, had strolled
thither to have a few words with his old shipmate.&nbsp; To his
surprise, he found a substitute on duty in the ferry-boat, and
discovered from that gentleman that for the last three days Mr.
Clark, utilizing his favourite explanation of colic, had been
making holiday and seemingly intended to make holiday for several
days longer.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, learning that the present whereabouts of Mr. Clark
were unknown to his informant, strolled back into the town, and,
at the corner of the High Street, he encountered Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo!&rdquo; said Mr. Clark, awkwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why ain&rsquo;t you at the ferry?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>my</i> business, &rsquo;Orace,&rdquo;
stated Mr. Clark, restively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it is!&rdquo; retorted Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking you why you ain&rsquo;t
there!&rdquo;&nbsp; He apprehended the gala nature of Mr.
Clark&rsquo;s attire, and started in surprise.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&mdash;you ain&rsquo;t been love-making, &rsquo;ave
you, Sam&mdash;not on your wages?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such luck!&rdquo; replied Mr. Clark, ruefully.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I know where she lodges,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Oo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Miss Margureety Delafayne,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Clark, voicing the name in cadences of mournful satisfaction.</p>
<p><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>&ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;er!&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, with scant
interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgot all about that, and I
thought you &rsquo;ad, too.&nbsp; You generally does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watching &rsquo;er go in and out of
&rsquo;er front door these last two days,&rdquo; stated the
love-lore Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;Watched, unbeknown, from the
corner of the road, I &rsquo;ave.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve just come from
there now.&nbsp; Are you going to the theayter
to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s reply was pietistic in form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; said.&nbsp; Mr.
Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t missed a performance
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that proud boast he went on his way, and Mr. Dobb
resumed his homeward path.&nbsp; Passing the Magnolia Toilet
Saloon, a salvo of taps upon the window claimed his attention,
and glancing inside, he found himself being beckoned imperatively
by the proprietor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Lock&rsquo;s looking all over the place for
you,&rdquo; Mr. Tridge informed him.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E wants
you to &rsquo;urry round to the &lsquo;Royal William&rsquo; soon
as ever you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chap &rsquo;oose wife tried to poison &rsquo;im
with the big eyes&mdash;&rdquo; replied Mr. Tridge, a trifle
obscurely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poison &rsquo;im with big eyes?&rdquo; murmured Mr.
Dobb, grappling with the enigma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first hact,&rdquo; supplied Mr. Tridge,
helpfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;So Peter says.&nbsp; I was
asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, now I know!&nbsp; Well, what about
&rsquo;im?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s practising &rsquo;is billiards at the
&lsquo;Royal William.&rsquo;&nbsp; Peter thought &rsquo;e might
come in useful somewhere, sometime, some&rsquo;ow.&nbsp; You
know&mdash;that glass shandyleary of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, without wasting time on mere social amenities,
straightway turned and set out for the <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>&ldquo;Royal William.&rdquo;&nbsp; Entering the
billiard-room, he found it to be occupied by but two
persons.&nbsp; Of these, one was the marker, Mr. Peter Lock, and
the other was an individual of attenuated physique, theoretically
clean-shaven, but actually rather blue-chinned.&nbsp; A top hat,
worn occipitally, graced the stranger&rsquo;s head, and an
overcoat, featuring some kind of strange fur on its collar, hung
on a peg behind the door.&nbsp; These clues, in conjunction with
Mr. Tridge&rsquo;s foreword, enabled Mr. Dobb to exploit the
occasion without further assistance from Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>Waiting till his old shipmate held temporary possession of the
table, Mr. Dobb approached the other gentleman in a manner which
can only be described as reverential.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;ope you&rsquo;ll pardon me for the liberty
I&rsquo;m taking, sir,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;but, of course,
I recognize you by sight, and I want to thank you for the treat
you give me the other night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo; returned the
stranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was it here, or at&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the theayter, sir.&nbsp; The way you done your
part!&rdquo; breathed Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was
wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>that</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed the other, with
marked gratification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most henjoyable, sir!&nbsp; Most hinteresting!&nbsp;
Most&mdash;most hartistic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good of you, sir, to say so.&nbsp; Of course
it&rsquo;s a strong part, to begin with, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but it takes a strong hactor to make the most of a
strong part,&rdquo; contended Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must confess that that big scene I have in the
second act&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; roundly asserted Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reg&rsquo;lar &rsquo;ad to grip my
chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then at the very end, you know,&rdquo; went on the
other, with ready enthusiasm, &ldquo;when I come forward and say,
&lsquo;So, madam, we meet again&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ve been more
thrilled,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb; and turned to frown his
disapproval of a slight hissing noise Mr. Lock was making behind
his palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a bit of a cold, sir,&rdquo; explained Mr. Lock;
and retired into his handkerchief for some moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderful performance, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb,
addressing the stranger again.&nbsp; &ldquo;And that of your good
lady, too&mdash;Miss Delafayne, I mean.&nbsp;
Most&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Delafayne is not my wife, sir.&nbsp; I appreciate
the privilege of being her business manager, but as for being her
husband&mdash;.&nbsp; In short, her temper!&nbsp; The artistic
temperament, of course&mdash;the artistic temperament,
but&mdash;&nbsp; As a matter of fact, Miss Delafayne is indeed
Miss Delafayne&mdash;she is unmarried.&nbsp; However, you were
kind enough to be talking of my humble talents&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And marvellous indeed they are!&rdquo; declared Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad to &rsquo;ave &rsquo;ad the
chance, sir, of thanking you for the pleasure your performance
give me.&nbsp; And I should be much honoured if you&rsquo;d allow
me to offer you some refreshment on the strength of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very graciously did the other permit Mr. Dobb to achieve this
distinction, and Mr. Lock at once performed the necessary
evolutions with a tray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your very good &rsquo;ealth, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
said Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me see, what is it?&nbsp; I
forgets the name, just for the minnit, but I remember the
face.&nbsp; &rsquo;Oo could ever <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>forget it, after &rsquo;aving seen
it once&mdash;on the stage, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bellaby,&rdquo; declaimed the gentleman in a fine,
rolling voice&mdash;&ldquo;Marmaduke Bellaby, sir, at your
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the swift development that thereupon characterized the
friendship thus began, it is unnecessary to write in
detail.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that within thirty minutes Mr.
Dobb was being addressed, with great frequency, as
&ldquo;laddie.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, as a pendant to this, it may be
added that, at an hour perilously close to that appointed for the
raising of the curtain at the theatre, Mr. Bellaby hurriedly
emerged from the portal of the &ldquo;Royal William&rdquo; and
went up the road at a trot, already fumbling alarmedly among his
tie and collar-stud and waistcoat buttons as he ran.&nbsp; A
cordial invitation he had extended at the last moment to Mr. Dobb
to witness the performance again that evening as a guest was
refused, regretfully but very definitely, on the score of a
previous engagement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not likely!&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb to Mr. Lock, when they
were alone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Once bit, twice jolly, blessed
careful!&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m glad you sent for me, Peter.&nbsp; I
think &rsquo;e&rsquo;ll be useful&mdash;when I can see my way to
using &rsquo;im.&nbsp; Anyway, I&rsquo;m meeting &rsquo;im again
to-morrow, and I shall take partic&rsquo;lar good care to meet
&rsquo;im again and again for the next few days, and &rsquo;oo
knows what&rsquo;s going to &rsquo;appen in this strange
world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do!&rdquo; answered Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very
often, anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Superfluous is it to say that Mr. Dobb kept to his expressed
intentions with regard to the gifted Mr. Bellaby, for to beat
along convivial paths in quest of profitable quarry was ever the
form of sportsmanship that appealed most strongly to Mr.
Dobb.</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>So
that Mr. Dobb and Mr. Bellaby became the closest of intimates
within a very brief while, and there were few of his spare hours
which Mr. Bellaby did not pass in the company of Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
And this was a state of affairs which naturally exercised a
financial reaction upon the latter gentleman, though he bore
philosophically with the expenditure in expectation of the reward
it would bring him eventually.</p>
<p>For the moment, however, he had to admit to himself that the
precise means to secure this reward was a matter which
obstinately eluded his ingenuity, so that his boon companionship
with Mr. Bellaby had in it something of that same fatalistic
force which impels the gambler to continue to wager
optimistically on the same unsuccessful racehorse.</p>
<p>And so, for several days, the friendship bloomed in profuse
flower, and behind Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s artless joviality and pride
in the companionship of the gifted Mr. Bellaby there was no hint
of the problem that obsessed his mind.&nbsp; It was only when Mr.
Dobb was alone that geniality dropped from him and was succeeded
by a morose calculativeness.</p>
<p>And this was his mood one evening when, parting from Mr.
Bellaby at the very stage-door with the expressed intention of
attending to certain neglected business, he encountered the
lovesick Mr. Samuel Clark.</p>
<p>Dull and vacant was the look in Mr. Clark&rsquo;s eyes,
dejected was the hump of his shoulders.&nbsp; Had not Mr. Dobb
accosted him he would have passed straight on, so apathetic was
the stout ferryman towards his surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo, Misery!&rdquo; greeted Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo, &rsquo;Orace,&rdquo; returned Mr.
Clark, in slow, unhappy tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When&rsquo;s the wedding coming off?&rdquo; bantered
Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark started violently and said something reprehensible
about Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s inquisitiveness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;is it all off, Sam?&rdquo; teased Mr.
Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It are!&nbsp; Not that there was any real chance of it
ever being on, but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head dolefully and added an unkind aspiration
with regard to Mr. Joseph Bindley&rsquo;s future state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s &rsquo;e to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heverything!&nbsp; Mind you, I was never fool enough to
think that a girl like &rsquo;er&mdash;well a woman like
&rsquo;er, then,&rdquo; he amended, in deference to Mr.
Dobb&rsquo;s startled exclamation&mdash;&ldquo;that a woman like
&rsquo;er would ever take to a old chap like me.&nbsp; I admit I
was romantical, but&mdash;but one never knows, do one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might &rsquo;ave been &rsquo;er ideal, Sam,&rdquo;
conceded Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;As you says, one can&rsquo;t ever
know for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, if ever I&rsquo;d got to know &rsquo;er
properly&mdash;&rdquo; said Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did once
fetch a cab for &rsquo;er,&rdquo; he went on, smiling
pathetically at the happy memory.&nbsp; &ldquo;And she thanked me
and give me thrippence.&nbsp; At least, she sent it out to me
with &rsquo;er thanks.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t ever spoke to
&rsquo;er, reely.&nbsp; And now that &rsquo;ere
Bindley&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped emotionally, and then again voiced an uncharitable
interest in Mr. Bindley&rsquo;s eventual destination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but what&rsquo;s Bindley to do with it?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is a free country, ain&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bindley&rsquo;s a-carrying on with &rsquo;er!&rdquo;
stated Mr. Clark, passionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
keeping my heye on &rsquo;er, so <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>I know.&nbsp; This last day or two
I&rsquo;ve stood &rsquo;elpless at the corner of &rsquo;er road
and seen &rsquo;im call for &rsquo;er and take &rsquo;er out time
and time again.&nbsp; Good as hengaged to each other, they are,
so &rsquo;er landlady&rsquo;s &rsquo;usband&rsquo;s brother told
me&mdash;and learning <i>that</i> cost me one and seven.&nbsp;
Yes; and this very hafternoon I see &rsquo;em side by side on a
seat on the cliffs, where I&rsquo;d followed &rsquo;em, and they
was playing slap &rsquo;ands, if you please.&nbsp; What do you
make of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to promise to be nothing more
than a brother to &rsquo;er, after all, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr.
Dobb, with an unsympathetic levity which caused his companion to
stare at him in a wounded way and then stalk offendedly on.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, resuming his way, reached his abode, and sat down in
an arm-chair to indulge in meditation.&nbsp; At the end of twenty
minutes he leaped to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough!&rdquo; he cried, joyously.</p>
<p>Mr. Marmaduke Bellaby, sauntering abroad on the morrow, found
himself met by Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; In this there was no novelty, nor
was there in their consequent adjournment to the &ldquo;Royal
William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;ow did the show go last night?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great, laddie, great!&rdquo; returned the other, though
not entirely convincingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ave a crowded haudience?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bellaby regarded Mr. Dobb quizzically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
we didn&rsquo;t exactly have to turn them away from the
doors,&rdquo; he confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
&rsquo;appened to look in later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make certain,&rdquo; replied Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You see, <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>between you and me, it&rsquo;s no secret that business
is rotten at the theayter, is it?&nbsp; And it certainly was
rotten last night&mdash;not half it wasn&rsquo;t, was
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been like that all the week,&rdquo; gloomily said Mr.
Bellaby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that could be haltered,&rdquo; observed Mr. Dobb
sagely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I got a idea.&nbsp; Do us both good, it
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the scheme?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lose &rsquo;er jewels,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Dobb,
mysteriously.</p>
<p>Mr. Bellaby, with a superior smile, stigmatized the suggestion
as both stale and threadbare.&nbsp; To this Mr. Dobb replied
that, elaborated according to the notion he had in mind, the
artifice would none the less prove successful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you, it&rsquo;s quite time we did
something,&rdquo; frankly conceded Mr. Bellaby.&nbsp; &ldquo;Talk
about frosts!&nbsp; She was saying to me only yesterday that if
things didn&rsquo;t improve&mdash;&nbsp; Of course for my own
sake, I&rsquo;d like things to improve, but what can one
do?&nbsp; We&rsquo;d all like to hit on something good.&nbsp; But
as for losing her jewels, my dear old boy&mdash;oh, my dear old
boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind if they did start the idea in the year
dot,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Shore&rsquo;aven
public ain&rsquo;t too used to the idea to sit up and take
notice, anyway.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got plenty of
jew&rsquo;l&rsquo;ry to lose, ain&rsquo;t she?&nbsp; For myself,
I never &rsquo;eard anyone rattle quite so much on the stage as
she do.&nbsp; Of course, <i>we</i> knows it ain&rsquo;t real,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such an old, old scheme, though,
laddie,&rdquo; objected Mr. Bellaby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait and listen to me.&nbsp; I tell you candid that
I want this idea worked because it&rsquo;s bound to be a good
hadvertisement for me as well as for &rsquo;er.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;ll get <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>most good out of it.&nbsp; People&rsquo;ll talk about
it, and they&rsquo;ll flock to see &rsquo;er at the
theayter.&nbsp; But they&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ear about my business,
too, and that&rsquo;s what I want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s hear, anyway,&rdquo; said Mr.
Bellaby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It begins with &rsquo;er &rsquo;aving &rsquo;er
jew&rsquo;l&rsquo;ry stole.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s to say, you
arrange things with &rsquo;er, and brings the whole lot down to
me secret.&nbsp; Well, next thing, you plasters all over the town
a full list of the missing jewels, except, of course,
there&rsquo;s no need to use the word
&rsquo;himitation.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Bellaby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You &rsquo;eads the bill &lsquo;One &rsquo;Undred
Pounds Reward,&rsquo; promising that to anyone assisting in the
recovery of &rsquo;er jewels.&nbsp; And you lets the town study
that &rsquo;ere bill for a day or two.&nbsp; And then a chap
brings the jewels to my shop and tries to get me to buy
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E can&rsquo;t read print,&rdquo; explained Mr.
Dobb, with a wink, &ldquo;so &rsquo;e don&rsquo;t know about them
bills.&nbsp; I charges &rsquo;im with &rsquo;aving stolen
&rsquo;em, and am just going to send for the police, when
&rsquo;e clears out in a &rsquo;urry, leaving the jewels with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, now I see!&rdquo; observed the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hexactly.&nbsp; <i>I&rsquo;ve</i> &rsquo;ad &rsquo;em
all the time.&nbsp; Well, I now applies for the reward.&nbsp; The
affair &rsquo;as got into the papers, and every one&rsquo;s
talking about it.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a special performance,
where she wears all &rsquo;er recovered jew&rsquo;l&rsquo;ry, and
you &rsquo;ave me up on the stage and &rsquo;and over the reward
to me&mdash;simply a bit of blank paper in a henvelope, of
course, but I get a little publicity and <i>she</i> gets a lot of
publicity, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all bad,&rdquo; commended Mr. Bellaby.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You being a local man, it looks much more
genuine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In course it do.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just the
idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my word, it&rsquo;s worth
doing.&nbsp; Come to think of it, though, there&rsquo;s no need
for the jewels to leave her possession really.&nbsp; As long as
they&rsquo;re hidden&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s just where you miss the best part of
it!&rdquo; urged Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;When that chap runs out
of my shop, the jewels is spilled all over the place.&nbsp; If
you like, &rsquo;e &rsquo;alf stuns me too, to prevent
persoot.&nbsp; I know one or two safe chaps what can be passing a
minute or two after it&rsquo;s supposed to &rsquo;ave
&rsquo;appened, and they can &rsquo;elp gather up the jewels and
bathe my fore&rsquo;ead and so on.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ow&rsquo;s that
for a yarn for the &lsquo;Shore&rsquo;aven Gazette,&rsquo;
eh?&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s as good as a play in itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bellaby, critically examining the project in all its
facets, came at last to the warmest agreement as to its merits,
and there followed a period of undertones.&nbsp; Then, to
demonstrate his zeal in her cause, Miss Delafayne&rsquo;s manager
straightway departed to set the scheme before her, and Mr. Dobb
ordered himself a drink, which, before he consumed it, he waved
at his reflection in a mirror.</p>
<p>In a short while Mr. Bellaby buoyantly returned.&nbsp; He told
Mr. Dobb that Miss Delafayne had been suffering very severely
indeed from her artistic temperament when first he had broached
the subject to her, but he had left her in the sunniest and most
compliant of moods.&nbsp; Mr. Joseph Bindley, too, it seemed, was
thoroughly convinced of the merits of the scheme, and had
directed that his name, as proprietor of the theatre, should
figure in conjunction with Miss Delafayne&rsquo;s as offerers of
the reward.</p>
<p>Things being thus satisfactorily in trim, Mr. Bellaby departed
again to compile an imaginative list of the jewellery to be lost
by the world-famous actress.&nbsp; This done, he left the
catalogue with a printer for immediate <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>attention,
and repaired once more to the &ldquo;Royal William,&rdquo; where
he handed to Mr. Dobb an undistinguished-looking parcel.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, returning home a little later with this packet under
his arm, was hailed by Mr. Tridge from the latter&rsquo;s
doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you got there, &rsquo;Orace?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Tridge, curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A order for a glass shandyleary,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Dobb and passed on with lightsome step.</p>
<p>That same evening the town of Shorehaven found itself
furnished with material for thrilling gossip, for scarce a
thoroughfare was there that did not exhibit somewhere adown its
length the tally of the jewels that the talented lady temporarily
living in their midst had had the misfortune to lose.&nbsp; In
front of every printed handbill, with its fascinating heading of
&ldquo;&pound;100 Reward,&rdquo; there lingered an absorbed
group, reading amazedly of ropes of pearls, and large and small
diamond brooches, of valuable rubies, and rare metals.&nbsp; The
manner of their disappearance, and the scene whence they had
vanished, were details tactfully left vague, so that the ends of
publicity were further served by this opportunity to speculate
whether the noted absent-mindedness of genius or mere criminal
avarice were responsible for the lady&rsquo;s loss.</p>
<p>For two full days the town theorized and clicked its tongue,
and spoke either sympathetically or sneeringly of the
affair.&nbsp; Attendance at the theatre suddenly improved, and
appreciation which had been denied to Miss Delafayne as a
performer was now showered on her as a lady who was supporting
material loss with great dignity.&nbsp; Sceptics there certainly
were, but these were in a minority, and their number would have
been <a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>even less had that perfervid admirer, Mr. Samuel Clark,
had the physical powers to convert those disbelievers he happened
to encounter.</p>
<p>And then one afternoon Mr. Horace Dobb sent a dictatorial and
even arrogant message to Mr. Joseph Bindley, demanding that
gentleman&rsquo;s attendance at the little shop in Fore Street at
once.&nbsp; Mr. Bindley, a gentleman plain of speech and blunt of
manner, went immediately to Mr. Dobb to ask him what he meant by
such a message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a glass shandyleary what belongs by rights to the
ceiling of your theayter,&rdquo; returned Mr. Dobb, equably,
&ldquo;and I want to sell it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bindley, as became a man who had attained the position of
theatrical proprietor, heatedly gave his opinion of such
impertinence and strode to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you rather mixed up with me to act so
&rsquo;aughty?&rdquo; asked Mr. Dobb, in civil accents.</p>
<p>Mr. Bindley halted and swung round to stare at Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get trying to play any tricks with
me!&rdquo; he warned Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a
understanding, and you stick to it, and I stick to it, and
there&rsquo;s an end of it!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want no
&rsquo;anky-panky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-five quid&mdash;that was what I was going to ask
for that shandyleary,&rdquo; mentioned Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Only I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad a lot of hincidental expenses
with it lately, so I&rsquo;m asking thirty-eight now.&nbsp; And
it&rsquo;s worth it&mdash;well worth it.&nbsp; You &rsquo;ave a
look at it, and you&rsquo;ll say so, too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the game?&rdquo; said Mr. Bindley,
aggressively.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you trying on&mdash;a sort of
blackmail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, that&rsquo;s what it really is,&rdquo;
acquiesced Mr. <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>Dobb, very smoothly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only you call it that
again, and up goes the price a quid a time!&nbsp; See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bindley, snorting, laid his palm on the handle of the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tells me Miss Delafayne &rsquo;as got a dooce of a
temper,&rdquo; observed Mr. Dobb, irrelevantly.</p>
<p>Mr. Bindley plucked open the door and marched out.&nbsp; Five
yards away he halted and came back again to the threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that got to do with it?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lovely shandyleary,&rdquo; declared Mr.
Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To blazes with your shandyleary, and you too!&rdquo;
bawled the choleric Mr. Bindley.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
speak straight out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I&rsquo;m going to,&rdquo; answered Mr. Dobb;
and abruptly abandoned his pose of suavity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look
&rsquo;ere, Bindley, I&rsquo;ve got you tied up tight!&nbsp;
See?&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere, glance at that little notice on the wall
there.&nbsp; &lsquo;Strictly Business!&rsquo; that says,
don&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s my motter.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been planning to sell you that shandyleary, and
I&rsquo;m going to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; scornfully returned Mr. Bindley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh-ing or no huh-ing, I&rsquo;m going to!&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t &rsquo;elp yourself.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been trying a
bit of artfulness with the public over them lost jewels, so you
can&rsquo;t squeal if some one else tries &rsquo;is artfulness on
you.&nbsp; Fust of all, you don&rsquo;t mind admitting I&rsquo;ve
got that parcel of coloured beads and brass, do you?&nbsp;
Suppose I goes and calls in the first ten chaps I meet outside
and tells &rsquo;em &rsquo;ow that jew&rsquo;l&rsquo;ry come into
my &rsquo;ands?&nbsp; That would make you look pretty foolish,
wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could say you stole them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not good enough.&nbsp; I can prove any amount of <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>alleybys.&nbsp; I could prove there couldn&rsquo;t be
no other way they <i>could</i> &rsquo;ave got into my &rsquo;ands
except through Bellaby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could say he stole them, and you were the
receiver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so you could,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Dobb; &ldquo;and
we wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;alf &rsquo;ave a chatty time in the dock
explaining &rsquo;ow it all really came about.&nbsp; They
wouldn&rsquo;t overlook your trying to deceive &rsquo;em, as you
&rsquo;ave done, in a &rsquo;urry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;m to buy the shandyleary to prevent the
truth coming out, am I?&rdquo; said Mr. Bindley, not without
admiration.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty smart, but not smart
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been smart enough in your time, from what
they tells me about you,&rdquo; returned Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You ought to be smart enough now to see you&rsquo;re
cornered.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ve got you any number of ways.&nbsp;
I could sue you for the reward, for example, if I went about the
thing carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, couldn&rsquo;t I deny they were the jewels?&nbsp;
They won&rsquo;t agree exact with the description, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I thought you might say that!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my
trump card.&nbsp; You say they ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;er
jewels?&nbsp; Very well, I hexibits the &rsquo;ole jolly
collection in the very front of my window, and pastes the reward
bill over &rsquo;em, and writes a paper beside &rsquo;em what
says: &lsquo;These jewels &rsquo;ave been found and &rsquo;ave
not been claimed by anyone.&nbsp; They are all false, and Miss
Margureety Delafayne says they ain&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ers.&rsquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll start people putting two
and two together, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em!&rdquo; cried Mr. Bindley,
forcefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before ever I&rsquo;ll be blackmailed
out of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy enough to talk like that,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb,
reproachfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;But &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t you any
consideration <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>for <i>&rsquo;er</i>?&nbsp; Why soon as ever the story
gets round the town, she&rsquo;ll be the laughing-stock of the
place.&nbsp; &rsquo;Er and &rsquo;er false jewellery will be
&rsquo;eld up to ridicule wherever she goes.&nbsp; Besides, a
little bird &rsquo;as told me that you and &rsquo;er are doing a
bit of courting.&nbsp; Well, if what I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eard of
&rsquo;er temper is true, she&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave something to
say to you for allowing &rsquo;er to be made ridic&rsquo;lous
like that, when you could &rsquo;ave prevented it.&nbsp;
Straight, if I was you, Bindley, I wouldn&rsquo;t lose a fiancy
like that and a bargain of a shandyleary for thirty-nine paltry
quid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bindley, his complexion of a fine purple hue, stood
staring at Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dirty trick!&rdquo; he gasped at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dessay,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
all got to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if&mdash;if I was fool enough to buy your
confounded shandyleary, how do I know you wouldn&rsquo;t diddle
me again?&nbsp; You might keep some of them jewels back
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, quite
eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to &rsquo;ave finished
with such trickery on the public.&nbsp; You give me a cheque for
that shandyleary, and you can take the jew&rsquo;l&rsquo;ry away
with you when you go, if you like.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll know it
ain&rsquo;t safe to stop the cheque, because that would lead to
all sorts of hinquiries, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t dream of giving you a cheque.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d blackmail me again over that, some&rsquo;ow.&nbsp;
But I&rsquo;ve got some notes on me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty quid?&rdquo; asked Mr. Dobb, urbanely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the price up-to-date, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the shandyleary?&rdquo; growled Mr.
Bindley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Downstairs in my cellar.&nbsp; And &rsquo;ere&rsquo;s
the jew&rsquo;l&rsquo;ry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, lifting a package from beneath his counter, <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>opened the
wrapping and displayed a mass of personal ornament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You compare that with the list and you&rsquo;ll find
there ain&rsquo;t a thing missing,&rdquo; he said, tying up the
parcel again and returning it beneath the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see the shandyleary,&rdquo; grunted
Mr. Bindley, with ill grace, &ldquo;and maybe I&rsquo;ll offer
you a price for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoke like a sensible man!&rdquo; declared Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in three parts.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
carry &rsquo;em up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elatedly he tripped down into his cellar.&nbsp; He was just
about to pick up the nearest portion of the chandelier, when a
sudden anguish assailed him.&nbsp; With an anxious cry he ran
back up the stairway again.&nbsp; The shop was empty.&nbsp; Mr.
Dobb darted behind his counter.&nbsp; The parcel was gone.&nbsp;
He raced out into the roadway, and was rewarded with a view of
Mr. Bindley, the parcel tight-clutched beneath his arm, rapidly
retiring down the perspective.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb opened his mouth to shout, then blinked and became
thoughtful.&nbsp; And, at long last, he made a helpless,
fluttering gesture with his hands and retired forlornly into his
shop.</p>
<p>That same evening Mr. Clark, in a state of considerable
jubilation, came to see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad a bit of luck to-day!&rdquo;
babbled the stout ferryman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I met &rsquo;er face to
face, and I&rsquo;m cured!&nbsp; Why, close to, she&rsquo;s
nearly &rsquo;alf as old as I am!&nbsp; Bindley was with
&rsquo;er, and that&rsquo;s what I come to see you about, to see
if you can hexplain the mystery.&nbsp; He saw me &rsquo;anging
about the corner, as usual, and &rsquo;e asked me if I&rsquo;d do
a little job for &rsquo;im, seeing as &rsquo;e reckoned to
&rsquo;ave a busy time before the hopening of the
theayter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; sourly prompted Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>&ldquo;Well, first of all, &rsquo;e give me a bob, and
then &rsquo;e give me a letter to deliver by &rsquo;and, marked
&lsquo;Hurgent,&rsquo; to the heditor of the
&lsquo;Shore&rsquo;aven Gazette.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; commented Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that ain&rsquo;t the mystery.&nbsp; Then &rsquo;e
give me another bob and a &rsquo;eavy little parcel to be left at
the stage-door.&nbsp; It was addressed to Miss Margureety
Delafayne, and on it was written in pencil, &lsquo;<i>From one
&rsquo;oo repents</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, seeing &rsquo;e was with
&rsquo;er at the time, what did &rsquo;e want to send that there
parcel to the theayter for?&nbsp; And what did that bit about
repenting mean?&nbsp; Can <i>you</i> see any sense in
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, churlishly and
untruthfully.</p>

192</span><i>EPISODE IX</i><br />
THE GREEN EYES OF THE LITTLE BIRMINGHAM GOD</h2>
<p>Mr. Horace Dobb sharply closed the tattered volume which had
been occupying his leisure, and looked up as if something were
momentarily dazzling him.&nbsp; And next he removed his slippered
feet from the mantelshelf and very slowly and carefully described
an arc with his heels until he was sitting erect in his chair,
alertly yet contemplatively, and also with a suggestion of
breathlessness, in the manner of one who is visited by an
inspired idea.</p>
<p>For a full minute Mr. Dobb remained thus, and then he rose and
shuffled out into his shop.&nbsp; Here he opened a cupboard to
take from it a small metallic object.&nbsp; Returning to his
parlour, he placed this object on the table, and it stood
revealed as a posturing figure of tarnished brass, ostensibly
Oriental in origin.</p>
<p>And now for a long, long while Mr. Dobb stared at this figure
in deep meditation, with his eyelids twitching and flickering
impatiently when, now and then, he found that his inventiveness
had stampeded him into some mental cul-de-sac.&nbsp; And then he
began to pace the narrow confines of the room, walking in a
tense, rigid way, as though his thoughts were so delicately
balanced on each other that the slightest disturbance of their
equilibrium would send them scattering uselessly in all
directions.</p>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>But
at last he halted, nodded his head thrice with keen satisfaction
at the idol on the table, and then came to the greatest
animation, whistling, snapping his fingers, and even pirouetting
a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green heyes and all, just like it says in the
book,&rdquo; he remarked, enigmatically.</p>
<p>And with that he bundled the idol back into its cupboard, and
set forth to confabulate with Mr. Peter Lock at his place of
employment.</p>
<p>The hour happily being that usually devoted to siesta, Mr.
Dobb found Mr. Lock quite alone at his post in the billiard-room
at the &ldquo;Royal William Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb at once put to Mr. Lock a direct question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; murmured Mr. Lock,
reflectively.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s two or three of
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; &rsquo;Specially at billiards.&nbsp; But, on the
whole, I should say that Sinnett is.&nbsp; Come to think of it,
I&rsquo;m pretty certain he is.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know where
you&rsquo;d find a bigger, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but does &rsquo;e think &rsquo;e&rsquo;s
smart?&rdquo; asked Mr. Dobb. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of mug
<i>I&rsquo;m</i> after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the sort what&rsquo;s so busy thinking about
his cleverness,&rdquo; replied Mr. Lock, &ldquo;that he
don&rsquo;t have a moment to spare for finding out what a fool he
really is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sort what&rsquo;s good for
trade,&rdquo; declared Mr. Dobb, appreciatively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s just the kind of chap I&rsquo;m
needing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the game this time?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hidols&rsquo; heyes,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I been reading a book,&rdquo; he continued in response to
Mr. Lock&rsquo;s uncomprehending stare.&nbsp; &ldquo;And there
was a hidol in it what &rsquo;ad real hemerald heyes, and this
&rsquo;ere hidol was stole from a temple somewhere out foreign by
a couple of chaps what didn&rsquo;t know about its heyes, and
there <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>wasn&rsquo;t half some murders and niggers and things
in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s a old, old plot,&rdquo; said Mr.
Lock, disparagingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re losing your dash,
&rsquo;Orace.&nbsp; Fancy you having to go to books to learn
anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps it&rsquo;ll be a noo enough plot so
far as this &rsquo;ere Mr. Sinnett is concerned,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Dobb, unruffled.</p>
<p>He tarried some while longer in intimate discussion with Mr.
Lock, and then departed to interview another member of the
translated crew of the obsolete &ldquo;Jane Gladys,&rdquo; in the
plump and venerable person of Mr. Samuel Clark, the ferryman.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark, perceiving the advent of Mr. Dobb, came forward to
greet him with marked expectancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam, do you know a chap called Sinnett&mdash;Mr. George
Sinnett?&rdquo; queried Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeaky voice, leather gaiters, nose like a fox?&rdquo;
sketched Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Know</i> &rsquo;im?&nbsp; I <i>&rsquo;ate</i>
&rsquo;im!&rdquo; stated Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as well,&rdquo; sagely remarked Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nothing like a bit of feeling to make a man sincere in his
hefforts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this &rsquo;ere Sinnett is the next down on our
list, Sam,&rdquo; announced Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s down for a Hindian hidol&mdash;fifteen
pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And us?&rdquo; quickly asked Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Alf of it between the three of you,&rdquo;
promised the master-mind of the confederacy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can
hafford to be generous.&nbsp; It only cost me
three-and-six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brummagem?&rdquo; next inquired Mr. Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; denied Mr. Dobb, flippantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Real native <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>Hindian work&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I give such a
&rsquo;igh price for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Sinnett&rsquo;s going to pay fifteeen quid for
it?&rdquo; raptly cried Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;appy
day!&nbsp; A dozen times &rsquo;ave I ferried &rsquo;im across,
and never so much as a a&rsquo;penny for a tip!&nbsp; And then
&rsquo;e &rsquo;ad the sauce to say that the fare ought to be
less at low tide, because the distance ain&rsquo;t so
far!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, &ldquo;everything
comes to &rsquo;im &rsquo;oo don&rsquo;t mind laying low for a
bit.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s &rsquo;is &rsquo;ouse of call, do you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Flag and Pennant&rsquo; yonder, when
&rsquo;e ain&rsquo;t trying to play billiards at the &lsquo;Royal
William.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; mentioned Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ave you got any old scars or wounds on
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this old cut on the back of my
&rsquo;and, what I done that night I was shaving in the
fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle when Alf Runnett come down and tickled me,
playful, because &rsquo;is gal &rsquo;ad gone off with some one
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just right,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, examining the
cicatrice; and forthwith adopted a preceptory attitude towards
the stout ferryman.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark, at the end of ten minutes of instruction, asked a
few questions to dispel one or two uncertainties of mind, and
then professed a complete trust in his ability to carry out Mr.
Dobb&rsquo;s directions.&nbsp; Mr. Dobb, after satisfying himself
by something in the nature of a rehearsal that Mr. Clark&rsquo;s
confidence was well founded, then passed on for the purpose of
seeking an interview of connective interest with Mr. Joseph
Tridge, fourth member of the confederacy established long ago in
the bowels of the inglorious &ldquo;Jane Gladys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That same evening Mr. George Sinnett was taking <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>his ease in
the bar-parlour of the &ldquo;Flag and Pennant&rdquo; when Mr.
Samuel Clark entered the apartment a little precipitously and
flung himself into a chair beside Mr. Sinnett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; passionately remarked Mr.
Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get me rights yet!&nbsp;
Fair&rsquo;s fair, ain&rsquo;t it, Sinnett?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sinnett turned and regarded the ferryman with considerable
coldness, for Mr. Clark was presumptuously flinging a bridge
across a well-defined social space.&nbsp; Mr. Sinnett, noting
that the ferryman was a little glassy of orb and rather reckless
about the disposition of his legs, frowned unencouragingly and
looked away again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair&rsquo;s fair!&rdquo; again asserted Mr. Clark,
dogmatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Im and me was both in it, and
that&rsquo;s what I got for a start-off!&nbsp; Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sinnett aloofly disdained the invitation, and next became
aware that the back of a huge hand was floating to and fro a few
inches below his nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look at that afore it slips!&rdquo; directed Mr.
Clark, forcefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;See that scar?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
what I got for <i>my</i> share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Sinnett, not quite
comfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In-blooming-deed!&rdquo; asserted Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Just as I was climbing over the railings of the
temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Temple?&nbsp; What temple?&rdquo; asked Mr. Sinnett
puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I ain&rsquo;t such a fool as to tell you
that!&rdquo; vaunted Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the nigger on
guard gave me a lick across the back of the &rsquo;and with
&rsquo;is sword, and&mdash;&nbsp; My chum got away all right,
though.&nbsp; At least, &rsquo;e was my chum in those days.&nbsp;
But <i>now</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Clark concluded his sentence with a deep-throated snarl,
eloquent of hatred, contempt, and smouldering fury.</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>Mr.
Sinnett, for lack of more intelligent comment, sipped at his
glass in a non-committal way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s a sailor&rsquo;s life for fun and
hadventure!&rdquo; cried Mr. Clark; and uttered a few tuneful
roulades bearing upon his statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere!&rdquo; he said, ceasing suddenly to be
lyrical and leaning forward to address Mr. Sinnett in a kind of
large confidence.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s people fool enough
to think that I&rsquo;m &rsquo;anging about Shore&rsquo;aven just
to work the ferry!&nbsp; They thinks <i>that</i>, they do.&nbsp;
Let &rsquo;em, says I.&nbsp; So much the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what <i>are</i> you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Clark bent a little further forward and impressively
tapped Mr. Sinnett on the knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>&rsquo;E&rsquo;s</i> &rsquo;ere!&rdquo; he
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i>?&nbsp; Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the chap I&rsquo;ve been telling you about.&nbsp;
The chap &rsquo;oo &rsquo;elped me to steal the hidol out of that
sacred temple.&nbsp; Run away with it, &rsquo;e did, but I been
tracking &rsquo;im down all these years, and now I&rsquo;ve found
&rsquo;im!&nbsp; And if he ain&rsquo;t got that hidol
still&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valuable, is it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Sinnett,
intrigued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say.&nbsp; &rsquo;Im and me only sneaked it
for a lark, only them niggers took it so serious.&nbsp; It
don&rsquo;t look vallyble, any&rsquo;ow.&nbsp; Just a fat thing
with a fat face and a couple of bits of green glass for
heyes.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t as if it was made of gold, as
you could see at a glance.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t &rsquo;alf a
outcry when we took it, though.&nbsp; After us, they was, for
ever so long, and we &rsquo;ad to&mdash;to take to the jungle to
give &rsquo;em the slip.&nbsp; And then, one night while I was
asleep, my chum took the hidol out of my pocket and &rsquo;ooked
off with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you followed him?&rdquo; asked Mr. Sinnett, with
lively interest.</p>
<p><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>&ldquo;Everywhere!&nbsp; Worst of it was, wherever I
follered &rsquo;im, &rsquo;e&rsquo;d &rsquo;ad about a
year&rsquo;s start.&nbsp; But at last I&rsquo;ve found &rsquo;im,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a species of incredulous annoyance at his own garrulity,
Mr. Clark stopped abruptly and rose from his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You been letting me say more than I ought to!&rdquo; he
remarked, severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; returned Mr. Sinnett, smoothly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, you have not even told me the name
of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; and I ain&rsquo;t going to, neither!&rdquo;
truculently interrupted Mr. Clark; and marched from the
apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer!&rdquo; murmured Mr. Sinnett.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very
queer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later in the evening that gentleman, directing his
course homeward by accustomed paths, came to a length of quiet,
ill-lit thoroughfare, and here he found himself beholding the
unusual.&nbsp; For, in the very middle of the roadway, he could
clearly discern two men, who grappled earnestly with each other,
swaying this way and that in furious embrace, and yet preserving
an eerie and almost complete silence.</p>
<p>For some moments, Mr. Sinnett viewed this phenomenon in
amazement, and then he hurried forward.&nbsp; His advent appeared
to alarm the antagonists, for, as soon as he drew near, they
parted.&nbsp; One of them, presenting a stout figure tolerably
familiar to Mr. Sinnett, ran clumsily away down the road; the
other man, breathing exhaustedly, stood fumbling at his collar in
a dazed way.&nbsp; Mr. Sinnett, peering at his features through
the gloom, discovered him to be the man who kept the Magnolia
Toilet Saloon, one Mr. Joseph Tridge, to wit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the game?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Sinnett.</p>
<p><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>&ldquo;No game,&rdquo; puffed Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dead serious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that the ferryman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; cried Mr. Tridge, guiltily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No&mdash;oh, no!&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t &rsquo;im.&nbsp; It
wasn&rsquo;t anybody <i>you&rsquo;d</i> know.&nbsp; It&mdash;it
wasn&rsquo;t anybody <i>I</i> know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m certain&mdash;&nbsp; Did he attack you
sudden?&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t you call for the
police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;d rather not &rsquo;ave the
p&rsquo;lice mixed up with it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a&mdash;a private
affair.&nbsp; I&mdash;I&rsquo;m all right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tridge then stumbled dizzily against the other man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;here!&rdquo; cried Mr. Sinnett, in
concern.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, man, you&rsquo;re shaking all
over!&nbsp; Here, take my arm and lean on me.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Cutlass and Cannon&rsquo; is quite close; you&rsquo;d
better have something there to pick you up and pull you
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tridge lurched again, most convincingly, and Mr. Sinnett,
with many encouraging remarks, began to lead him towards the
tavern he had named.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Tridge, hazily,
&ldquo;&rsquo;e&mdash;&rsquo;e didn&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing&mdash;nothing!&nbsp; I&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t
thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A minute or so after they reached the &ldquo;Cutlass and
Cannon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here Mr. Tridge, with obvious effort, forced
himself to a normal deportment, thus escaping the curiosity of
the few patrons present in the tap-room.&nbsp; Under direction of
Mr. Sinnett, he sat down in a quiet corner, and soon, under the
influence of his companion&rsquo;s prescription, became quite
animated.&nbsp; A second potion having been swallowed, and a
third ordered, to make quite sure that the required dose should
lack nothing in strength, Mr. Sinnett coughed delicately and
addressed Mr. Tridge in winning accents.</p>
<p><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>&ldquo;You were telling me just now, when&mdash;when
you were taken queer out in the road&mdash;that that ferryman
didn&rsquo;t get what he was after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I tell you it was the ferryman?&nbsp; I never meant
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you did!&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s no harm
done.&nbsp; A secret is a secret with me.&nbsp; Same as I
shan&rsquo;t tell anyone,&rdquo; continued Mr. Sinnett, watching
his companion very closely, &ldquo;that what he was after was an
Indian idol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tridge started violently. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ow did you know
<i>that</i>?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you told me so yourself.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
remember?&rdquo; returned Mr. Sinnett, with a disarming
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t remember.&nbsp; My &rsquo;ead
was going round and round, and&mdash;&nbsp; Well, I <i>am</i> a
mug!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his glass and emptied it.&nbsp; Mr. Sinnett, eyeing
him with intensity, immediately had the measure refilled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge, defensively,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s as much mine as &rsquo;is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; readily agreed Mr. Sinnett.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, quite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E tried to serve me a dirty trick,&rdquo; said
Mr. Tridge, placing an argumentative forefinger on Mr.
Sinnett&rsquo;s necktie, &ldquo;and <i>I</i> served &rsquo;im one
instead.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s fair, ain&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; acquiesced Mr. Sinnett, with a
straining quality of helpfulness underlying his tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fair is fair, all the world over, of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course it is.&nbsp; And, mind you, I&rsquo;m
hobstinit.&nbsp; If &rsquo;e&rsquo;d come to me, fair and
reasonable, in the first place&mdash;&nbsp; You see what I
mean?&nbsp; But &rsquo;e didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Same as them nigger
chaps what &rsquo;ave follered me about from time to time,
wanting to buy it back.&nbsp; I told &rsquo;em <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>once I
wouldn&rsquo;t sell it, and what I says I sticks to.&nbsp;
See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear as clear.&nbsp; When your mind&rsquo;s made up,
it&rsquo;s made up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; accepted Mr. Tridge,
complacently. &ldquo;Follered me all over the place, they
&rsquo;ave and hoffered me any amount of money for it.&nbsp; But
I ain&rsquo;t a wobbler.&nbsp; What I says I sticks to.&nbsp;
See?&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s &rsquo;ave another!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Sinnett,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tried to steal it off me, them niggers
&rsquo;ave,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge, disdainfully, after the rites
consequent on a further libation had been observed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m a match for <i>them</i> any day.&nbsp; And
they talks about sticking me next time they come across me.&nbsp;
Let &rsquo;em try that on, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you think they are so anxious to get it
back?&nbsp; What do they want to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hidol!&rdquo; sagely returned Mr. Tridge, with an
explanatory wave of his glass.&nbsp; &ldquo;What they says their
prayers to.&nbsp; Sort of&mdash;sort of marscutt, you know.&nbsp;
You know, if you &rsquo;ad a marscutt and you lost it, &rsquo;ow
everything &rsquo;ud seem to go wrong for you?&nbsp; Not that
it&rsquo;s brought me much luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps these niggers you spoke of was at the back of
it?&rdquo; suggested Mr. Sinnett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge, with sublime
carelessness. &ldquo;There was always a nigger around whenever
things went wrong, anyway.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m a British seaman,
I am, and I don&rsquo;t take no notice of niggers.&nbsp;
See?&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m surprised as <i>you</i> should,
either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking,&rdquo; apologized Mr.
Sinnett. &ldquo;But tell me&mdash;do you think perhaps the idol
is valuable?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>Mr.
Tridge noisily laughed the notion to scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to see it!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just
a figger of fun made of brass, with bits of green glass for
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sinnett sat vigilantly upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but are you sure they <i>are</i> glass?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what else <i>could</i> they be?&rdquo; returned
Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;they might&mdash;&rdquo; began Mr. Sinnett,
and then checked himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Er&mdash;quite so,&rdquo;
he ended, belatedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What else <i>could</i> they
be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tridge, carelessly flicking the question out of the range
of further consideration, now stated that he felt quite recovered
from the attack that had been made upon him, and earnestly
besought Mr. Sinnett to maintain silence as to the incident, if
for no other reason than for the good repute of the Magnolia
Toilet Saloon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I been wild in my time,&rdquo; confessed Mr. Tridge,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t want folks to think that I&rsquo;m the
rough character I used to be.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; And now
good-night, and thank &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He steered for the door.&nbsp; Mr. Sinnett, with a kindly
smile, insisted on accompanying him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you might be took bad again,&rdquo; he urged,
linking arms with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come your way and
see you safe home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this he very charitably did.&nbsp; Mr. Tridge, although
leaning heavily on his companion&rsquo;s supportive arm, none the
less otherwise ignored the presence of Mr. Sinnett.&nbsp; Moved
by contact with the open air to a reflective mood, Mr. Tridge, as
he walked, growled aloud a resentful epitome of his conversation
in the &ldquo;Cutlass and Cannon,&rdquo; coming back again and
again to dwell on his firmness in refusing to part with his <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>booty.&nbsp; Arrived at the door of his lodgings, he
found his latchkey, and then turned to his escort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo, where did <i>you</i> spring from?&rdquo;
he asked, dully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been seeing you home,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Sinnett, in benevolent accents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like your cheek!&rdquo; grunted Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ne&rsquo; mind!&nbsp; Jolly good fellow!&nbsp; Mush
&rsquo;bliged!&nbsp; Goo&rsquo; night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door, and was passing over the threshold, when
Mr. Sinnett addressed him a little desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you&mdash;ain&rsquo;t you going to ask me
in?&rdquo; he queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge, flatly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
leave me &rsquo;lone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to have a look at that idol you
was talking about.&nbsp; Just&mdash;just see it, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hidol?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Tridge, staring about him
alarmedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What hidol?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
nothing about no hidol!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you&rsquo;ve been telling me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t never seen no hidol, not nowhere!&rdquo;
declared Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
you&rsquo;re talking about!&nbsp; Hidol, hindeed!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ere,&rdquo; he quavered, &ldquo;&rsquo;ave I been fool
enough to&mdash;&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s all right!&nbsp; I know I
ain&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;ve only jus&rsquo; met you this very
minute, and I ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;ad time to.&nbsp; Well,
goo&rsquo; ni&rsquo;, old chum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leered owlishly upon Mr. Sinnett, shook him by the hand,
and lurched most realistically over the threshold.&nbsp; Quietly
he shut the door, and instantly all inconsequence of manner
vanished from him.&nbsp; He stood to listen to the slow, receding
footsteps of Mr. Sinnett, and at that moment the two gentlemen
exhibited exactly the same exultant expression of
countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got &rsquo;im!&rdquo; remarked Mr. Tridge to
himself, with vast satisfaction.</p>
<p><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>&ldquo;Talk about sheer <i>luck</i>!&rdquo; joyously
murmured Mr. Sinnett, as he walked away.&nbsp; &ldquo;George, my
boy, you&rsquo;re on the track of something good!&nbsp; Why,
it&rsquo;s like one of them old detective tales come
true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the ensuing portion of the week, Mr. Sinnett&rsquo;s
everyday pursuits suffered neglect, for that worthy had
apparently conceived an obsession to have either Mr. Tridge or
Mr. Clark continually under observation.&nbsp; And so for each of
several mornings he entered the Magnolia Toilet Saloon and sat
him down on the bench where those waited who required Mr.
Tridge&rsquo;s professional services.</p>
<p>Here Mr. Sinnett would become so engrossed in the newspaper
that he would waive his turn for attention till he was the only
patron remaining.&nbsp; And when he had no further pretext for
lingering, he would be shaved, and then go off to the ferry,
where he would be needlessly rowed across the ferry and return by
that conveyance almost immediately.</p>
<p>And in the afternoon he would find that he had need of toilet
soap, or a bottle of hair-oil, and he would repair to Mr.
Tridge&rsquo;s establishment to procure such article, making the
matter of purchase as protracted a business as possible.&nbsp;
And then he would saunter down to the ferry and, alleging that
sea air was good for him, be taken several consecutive journeys
across the river under the impulse of Mr. Clark&rsquo;s
sculls.</p>
<p>And in the evening he would visit the &ldquo;Flag and
Pennant&rdquo; inn, or such other tavern as might be extending
its hospitality to Mr. Tridge or Mr. Clark, and here he would
laboriously contrive desultory conversation with one or other of
them until doors had to be closed, when his way would strangely
coincide with the <a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>homeward path of that gentleman of the twain in whose
society closing-time had found him.</p>
<p>But never a word was there spoken of an idol of any
sort.&nbsp; Twice or thrice Mr. Sinnett had broached Imperialism
as a topic of conversation, being thus enabled to allude to India
in a natural, unforced way.&nbsp; But mention of that empire had
instantly caused both Mr. Tridge and Mr. Clark to look suspicious
and markedly avoid any development of the subject, so that Mr.
Sinnett had to travel warily back, by way of Canada and Australia
and New Zealand, to shallower waters.</p>
<p>And, for their part, Mr. Tridge and Mr. Clark bore the
partiality of Mr. Sinnett for their society with nothing but a
nice air of gratitude for patronage.&nbsp; Not once did either of
them make allusion to that recent evening when they had shown him
something of the inner side of their confidence.&nbsp; And Mr.
Sinnett was glad that this should be so, for clearly, he argued,
it showed that the conversations had had no abiding place in
their memories.&nbsp; Wherefore, then, he cultivated their
company, waiting for a chance word to swell the bulk of his
secret information and give him assistance in turning this
knowledge to his own profit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever seen a cat waiting outside a
mouse-&rsquo;ole?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s &rsquo;im!&rdquo; Mr. Clark
privately reported to Mr. Horace Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bit of waiting don&rsquo;t do no &rsquo;arm,&rdquo;
said Mr. Dobb, sagaciously.&nbsp; &ldquo;The more time &rsquo;e
spends the less &rsquo;e&rsquo;ll like to think that it might
&rsquo;ave been wasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that it was not till one evening in the middle of the
following week that Mr. Sinnett was thrilled by a further
unwinding of the spool of adventure.</p>
<p>On that night, neither Mr. Clark nor Mr. Tridge <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>were to be
discovered in accustomed haunts, and Mr. Sinnett, fearful of this
coincidence, went from hostelry to hostelry in feverish
search.&nbsp; Returning to the &ldquo;Royal William Hotel&rdquo;
for a second time, he again questioned the billiard-marker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Tridge ain&rsquo;t been in here yet,
sir,&rdquo; Mr. Lock replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;In fact, I was just
wondering whether you&rsquo;d come across him anywhere.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s been some one inquiring very eager after him since
you was here a hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it&mdash;that ferryman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; a dark gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a nigger?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Sinnett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes; except that he was dressed quite
respectable,&rdquo; acquiesced Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, very
respectable indeed.&nbsp; He looked as if he might be pretty well
off at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say he wanted to see Tridge
important?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very important, so he said, sir.&nbsp; He said
something about only just having managed to find out where he
was, and about a boat sailing back almost immediate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um-m-m,&rdquo; commented Mr. Sinnett, and thoughtfully
began to stroke his chin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did he&mdash;did the
nigger say where he was stopping, or anything like
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp; I told him where Mr. Tridge lodged,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you shouldn&rsquo;t have done that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir?&nbsp; Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sinnett, without furnishing the explanation, stopped
short, for Mr. Tridge had just entered the room.&nbsp;
Conspicuously bandaged was Mr. Tridge&rsquo;s right hand, and a
huge asterisk of sticking-plaster decorated his left cheek.</p>
<p><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ad a bit of a haccident,&rdquo; he
returned, evasively, when Mr. Sinnett asked a surprised
question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cut meself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; further inquired Mr. Sinnett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a knife,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever was you a-doing of, sir?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s that got to do with you?&rdquo;
roared Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shut up and mind your own
business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, sir,&rdquo; humbly apologized Mr. Lock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By the way, sir, there was a dark gent inquiring for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge, curtly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
met &rsquo;im!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now the door opened, and the visage of Mr. Clark stared
round it.&nbsp; Vengeful and gloating was the stout
ferryman&rsquo;s face, and he nodded with malevolent satisfaction
at Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, &rsquo;e told me &rsquo;e &rsquo;ad!&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good luck to &rsquo;im!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get out!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Tridge,
passionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;Else I&rsquo;ll serve you like I did
&rsquo;im!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh, &rsquo;e was only shamming!&rdquo; retorted Mr.
Clark. &ldquo;&rsquo;E got up again and walked away soon as
you&rsquo;d gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, shut up, anyway!&rdquo; ordered Mr. Tridge, with
a warning scowl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;ve
said more than enough already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them?&rdquo; said Mr. Clark, glancing carelessly at Mr.
Sinnett and Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, &rsquo;e didn&rsquo;t get it, anyway!&rdquo;
declared Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;ll get it all right in the end,&rdquo;
prophesied Mr. Clark, darkly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mightn&rsquo;t get
off so lucky next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;ll never get it,&rdquo; stated
Mr. Tridge, with dour confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you deals fair by me,&rdquo; said Mr. Clark.
&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps he won&rsquo;t, then, not against the
two of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you I ain&rsquo;t sharing, once and for
all!&rdquo; bellowed Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; growled Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry.&nbsp; I could tell you something if
I liked.&nbsp; Made <i>me</i> sit up when I &rsquo;eard it,
anyway.&nbsp; Look &rsquo;ere, I give you fair warning&mdash;in
future it&rsquo;s either to be me and you, or me and
<i>&rsquo;im</i>!&nbsp; Take your choice.&nbsp; Anyway, after
what I&rsquo;ve learnt to-night, I&rsquo;m going to be <i>in</i>
it, some-&rsquo;ow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing!&rdquo; announced Mr. Tridge,
stoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Mr. Clark, in the most sinister
fashion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He withdrew.&nbsp; Mr. Tridge began to whistle a little
flatly, as though unaware of the absorbed gaze bent upon him by
the other two men present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reminds me&mdash;letter to post!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr.
Sinnett, suddenly; and followed after Mr. Clark, in a state of
the keenest excitement.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark had proceeded but as far as the tap-room of the
&ldquo;Royal William,&rdquo; and here Mr. Sinnett
unostentatiously took up a strategic position in the chair next
to him.&nbsp; For some while Mr. Clark displayed an introspective
moodiness, sipping at his refreshment and nodding his head with
the same grim air of determination.</p>
<p>But presently he turned towards Mr. Sinnett, and, after eyeing
him cautiously, addressed him in the gruff tones of one
determined to check any unnecessary extension of talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow much is hemeralds worth?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>&ldquo;Emeralds?&rdquo; fluttered Mr. Sinnett.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Emeralds?&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused to strive for greater
self-control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said,&rdquo; observed Mr. Clark,
surlily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hemeralds.&nbsp; You know, them green
stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it depends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Clark, and pointedly turned his
shoulder to Mr. Sinnett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how big are they?&rdquo; ventured Mr.
Sinnett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of &rsquo;em are a pretty fair size,&rdquo; said
Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it don&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp;
I&mdash;I was only just wondering.&nbsp; See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought his back even more deliberately into Mr.
Sinnett&rsquo;s cognizance, and the conversation ended.&nbsp;
And, a few minutes after, he quitted the room with so ungenial an
air that Mr. Sinnett had not the courage to accompany him.&nbsp;
And he found Mr. Tridge was gone from the billiard-room, so that
there was nothing left for Mr. Sinnett to do but to retire home
to spend a night of fitful slumber.</p>
<p>Early next morning did he enter the Magnolia Toilet Saloon,
drawn thither by an irresistible desire to keep abreast of every
development in this affair which so tantalizingly suggested
personal profit without indicating the means thereto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning, sir!&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning!&rdquo; returned Mr. Sinnett.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
just looked in to see how those wounds of yours are getting
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge;
and added, in the casual tones of heroism, &ldquo;Matter of fact,
it was a bit of a scrap.&nbsp; And, what&rsquo;s more, I
&rsquo;ad another one after I left you last evening.&nbsp; Only,
of course, I don&rsquo;t want you to talk about &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
It won&rsquo;t do this &rsquo;ere saloon no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and the second scrap?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>&ldquo;Ah, that was in my lodgings!&nbsp; When I got
&rsquo;ome,&rdquo; narrated Mr. Tridge, &ldquo;I see my window
open.&nbsp; Indoors I goes, very quiet.&nbsp; Blest if they
wasn&rsquo;t trying to burgle me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burgle you?&nbsp; Who was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&mdash;oh, just a couple of chaps.&nbsp; I
&rsquo;it out at &rsquo;em, and they closed with me.&nbsp; In the
end,&rdquo; concluded Mr. Tridge, modestly, &ldquo;they was both
glad enough to jump out of the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; breathed Mr. Sinnett.</p>
<p>Mr. Tridge smiled, and then broke into chuckles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a joke,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you something, if you promise
you won&rsquo;t repeat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I promise!&rdquo; cried Mr. Sinnett, readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they was after something that wasn&rsquo;t there
at all!&nbsp; Mind you, they <i>thought</i> it was!&nbsp; It was
something I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ad for a long time, and they was very
anxious to get it.&nbsp; Many and many a try they&rsquo;d
&rsquo;ad for it.&nbsp; But I wouldn&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em
&rsquo;ave it.&nbsp; The first scrap last night&mdash;that was
one of their hattempts.&nbsp; Any one might think it worth
&rsquo;undreds of pounds, the way they keeps on trying.&nbsp; But
it ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Sinnett, in strained
tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only as a curiosity.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s vallyble, far as
that goes.&nbsp; Anyway, I &rsquo;ad no difficulty in getting
twelve quid for it last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;ve sold it?&rdquo; cried Mr.
Sinnett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;ave.&nbsp; After that first scrap last night,
I got so sick about &rsquo;aving to bother about its being safe
always that I just took and sold it.&nbsp; Not to <i>them</i>, of
course, I wouldn&rsquo;t give in to <i>them</i>.&nbsp; I sold it
to Dobb, in Fore Street.&nbsp; &rsquo;E see at once that it was a
genuine curiosity, and &rsquo;e didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;aggle a
bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>For
several long seconds Mr. Sinnett stared at Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
Then, with a start, he purchased a superfluous stick of
shaving-soap, and wandered from the premises.&nbsp; Scarce had he
gone twenty yards when he found himself accosted by Mr. Peter
Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the very gent I was &rsquo;oping to see!&rdquo;
said Mr. Peter Lock, exhibiting suppressed excitement.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something a bit queer afoot, sir, what
I&rsquo;d like to talk over with you.&nbsp; You know about that
row Mr. Tridge &rsquo;ad with the ferryman last night.&nbsp; At
least, I think it&rsquo;s something to do with that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can talk in here,&rdquo; said Mr. Sinnett; and drew
Mr. Lock into the &ldquo;Bunch o&rsquo; Grapes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you, sir, I don&rsquo;t take no
responsibility,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
queer.&nbsp; That Indian gent come into the billiard-room not
half an hour ago.&nbsp; He said he&rsquo;d arranged to meet
Clark, the ferryman, there at noon, but he found he must get back
to London by the eleven-eleven train this morning.&nbsp; And so
he gave me a note to hand to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, he said something about advising Clark to
lay low after last night.&nbsp; He said he&rsquo;d forgot to put
that in the note, and asked me to mention it to Clark.&nbsp;
Remembered it just as he was going, he did, and come back to tell
me.&nbsp; Well, now, sir, I don&rsquo;t want to get mixed up in
no fishy cases.&nbsp; If you remember what them two was saying to
each other last night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the note,&rdquo; directed Mr. Sinnett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I was thinking, sir.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I
wanted to see you, because you was there and know as much about
it as I do.&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s any risk, I don&rsquo;t mean
to be in it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Mr. Sinnett.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Open the note and make sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a certain trembling eagerness, Mr. Sinnett watched Mr.
Lock draw an envelope from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can easily put it in a new envelope,&rdquo; said
Mr. Sinnett, as Mr. Lock began to stare perplexedly at the
flap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock, and at
once tore open the missive.&nbsp; It was very short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I am at 17</i>, <i>Somerset Terrace</i>,
<i>Poplar</i>, <i>till to-morrow</i>.&nbsp; <i>Ten my boat
sails</i>, <i>but letters there will be forwarded me</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Keep to our bargain</i>.&nbsp; <i>Do not forget that I am
prepared to pay a higher price than anyone else for
it</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; murmured Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventeen, Somerset Terrace, Poplar,&rdquo; muttered
Mr. Sinnett.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seventeen, Somer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you thing there&rsquo;s anything in the address,
sir?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lock, curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you take my advice,&rdquo; said Mr. Sinnett,
impressively, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll burn that note and say no more
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that would be safest,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Lock,
and, striking a match, ignited the missive in the fire-place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must be going,&rdquo; said Mr. Sinnett, coming
to a sudden briskness; and, settling the score, he hastened
away.</p>
<p>Five minutes later he was in the presence of Mr. Horace
Dobb.&nbsp; Permission to glance round the stock had been met
with suave and smiling acquiescence, and almost immediately Mr.
Sinnett, with false calm, was inquiring the price of a small
idol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That?&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d
let you have that <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>for twenty pounds.&nbsp; Genuine curiosity, that is,
sir.&nbsp; I dare say it&rsquo;s worth a lot more, but I want to
make you a customer.&nbsp; Ah, that won&rsquo;t be on my shelves
long, for all I only bought it last night.&nbsp; Always getting
inquiries for genuine foreign idols, I am.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
only one I&rsquo;ve got in my shop at present.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a lot of connoshers of them things
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty pounds?&rdquo; said Mr. Sinnett.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, man, I happen to know you only gave twelve for
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave given more if &rsquo;e&rsquo;d
pressed me, but &rsquo;e seemed anxious to get rid of it.&nbsp;
And, anyway, sir, I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave got twenty pounds easy
enough for it yesterday afternoon, if I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ad
it.&nbsp; There was a Indian gentleman in &rsquo;ere hinquiring
if by any chance I &rsquo;ad any hidols.&nbsp; Particular keen
&rsquo;e seemed to get one just like that.&nbsp; &rsquo;E might
&rsquo;ave been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen pounds,&rdquo; offered Mr. Sinnett.</p>
<p>And so it was; but even then, Mr. Dobb only yielded with
professed reluctance to losing the chance of Mr. Sinnett as a
regular patron thenceforward.</p>
<p>That same evening Mr. Clark, Mr. Tridge, and Mr. Lock
foregathered in Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s parlour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see &rsquo;im go,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;d got it in a portmanteau.&nbsp; Caught the
two-twenty-one, &rsquo;e did.&nbsp; &rsquo;E&rsquo;ll be in
London by now.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you fancy &rsquo;im getting more
and more hexcited at that &rsquo;ouse, trying to hexplain to
&rsquo;em that &rsquo;e wants to see a nigger they don&rsquo;t
know nothing about?&nbsp; And &rsquo;e&rsquo;ll think
they&rsquo;re trying to deceive &rsquo;im, and &rsquo;e&rsquo;ll
tell &rsquo;em all the &rsquo;ole story, just to show
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s telling the truth, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;e&rsquo;ll be very hagitated,&rdquo; said
Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s that sort, I bet, when
things goes sideways.&nbsp; Serve &rsquo;im right!&nbsp; Anyway,
thanks for my share, &rsquo;Orace.&nbsp; I shall <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>be able to
do a bit of slate-cleaning with it.&nbsp; By the way, what
haddress did you send &rsquo;im looking for, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventeen, Somerset Terrace, Poplar.&nbsp; &rsquo;Orace
told me to write down any old address I happened to think of,
didn&rsquo;t you, &rsquo;Orace?&nbsp; And Seventeen, Somerset
Terrace, come easiest to my mind.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know where
I got it from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventeen, Somerset&mdash;&rdquo; gasped Mr. Tridge and
Mr. Clark, simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I can tell you where you got it!&rdquo; shouted
Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;You come and see me and Sam Clark there
many a time while we was lodging there, when the old &lsquo;Jane
Gladys&rsquo; was being repaired that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, of course, I remember now!&rdquo; said Mr. Lock.
&ldquo;A nice, comfortable, homely place it was, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve sent Sinnett <i>there</i> to start
questioning and arguing and hexplaining?&rdquo; roared Mr.
Tridge. &ldquo;Why, Sam and me ran up a bill for the &rsquo;ole
six weeks we stopped there, and then we skipped off without
paying.&nbsp; And <i>now</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

215</span><i>EPISODE X</i><br />
THE GIRL HE LEFT BEHIND HIM</h2>
<p>That rising man of affairs, Mr. Horace Dobb, was setting out
on his afternoon stroll&mdash;which is relatively equivalent to
saying that Beau Nash had just appeared in the Pump Room at Bath,
or that the Prince Regent had issued forth to sun himself on the
Steine at Brighthelmstone.</p>
<p>For, whatever drab limitations the keeping of a second-hand
shop might impose upon Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s wardrobe during the
exigencies of the morning, the afternoon would almost invariably
have the gratification of witnessing that gentleman&rsquo;s
apotheosis.&nbsp; Then Mr. Dobb who spent his mornings in
dragging bulky things about in the remote dustiness of his
outhouse, or in cajoling and brow-beating clients across the
counter, was as different from the Mr. Dobb of the afternoon as
is the lowly grub from the full-winged butterfly.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, because he deemed that he owed a fitting publicity
to his occupation and to his own personality, had taken the hours
which intervene between dinner and tea, and had incorporated them
into a general scheme for his glorification.&nbsp; Other business
men might permit the searching post-meridian sunshine to
illuminate frayed cuffs and shiny elbows, to exhibit symptoms of
haste and heedlessness upon waistcoat fronts, to reveal
circumstantial evidence with regard to linen collars.&nbsp; Such
negligence of apparel had ceased to be any part of Mr.
Dobb&rsquo;s policy.</p>
<p><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>Wherever the calls of his profession might lead him
abroad after dinner, either to auction sales or to visits for
private appraisement, to interviews for preliminary negotiation
or merely to casual scoutings for opportunities of profit, Mr.
Dobb&rsquo;s aim was to appear fresh and impeccably groomed and,
as far as possible, aristocratic.&nbsp; Careful study of toilet
and deportment, he was convinced, must inevitably bring him the
pleasing reputation of being a leader of fashion, and,
furthermore, could not but impress people with the desirability
of dealing with so distinguished a person when they had rickety
sofas and deficient clocks and old ironmongery to sell.</p>
<p>And so Mr. Dobb was sauntering forth in all his accustomed
splendour.&nbsp; Upon his sleekly anointed hair there rested a
soft felt hat of exceeding plushiness, with a tuft of strange
feathers thrust into its band to hint at sporting prowess.&nbsp;
A very high and very stiff collar encircled Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s
throat, and upon a necktie of cheerful patterning there was
pillowed a scarfpin conspicuously, like the headlight upon a
locomotive.&nbsp; A shaggy tweed suit, of a hue which far
o&rsquo;erleapt snuff and only narrowly missed mustard, graced
Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s frame, and his feet were encased in
orange-coloured boots of a squeakiness surely without
parallel.</p>
<p>And when the eye had become inured to these glories, returning
powers of vision brought apprehension of a silver-mounted cane,
of a buttonhole of geranium blooms, of a cigar, and a festooning
watch-chain, and of the phenomena of tan gloves, not worn on the
hands, but carried carelessly, as though their presence were due
to a merest afterthought on the part of lazy luxury.</p>
<p>And thus, as it were, glossed and burnished and intensified,
Mr. Dobb progressed down Fore Street.&nbsp; One <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>hand
jauntily twirled the cane, the other hand not only had the
distinction of flourishing the gloves in airy greeting of such
neighbours as Mr. Dobb insisted should see him, but also was
called on, from time to time, to assist in making great play with
the cigar, a duty which it performed with many graceful twirls of
the wrist.</p>
<p>And thus did Mr. Dobb arrive at the corner where Fore Street
joins Bridge Street, and here he paused to gaze up and down the
road.&nbsp; A fine sense of dominance permeated Mr. Dobb as he
stood there, and the expression with which he viewed the
amenities of the place was one nicely calculated to hover midway
between languid interest and patrician disdain.</p>
<p>And then, as an ancient ewer may be rare and valuable ware in
one moment and, in the next, be but so much broken crockery, so
in a twinkling was Mr. Dobb transformed from a proud autocrat to
a quaking fugitive.</p>
<p>Gone was all trace of hauteur from his face, vanished
completely was all swaggering complacency of manner.&nbsp; There
was a hunted look in his eyes, and he had become limp and
drooping and manifestly unstable at the knees.</p>
<p>And the whole change had happened in that trice which is
occupied by the clash of two pairs of eyes meeting each other in
a glance of recognition across a narrow thoroughfare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Strewth!&rdquo; breathed Mr. Dobb, aghast, and
made a convulsive, clutching movement towards his hat, but
checked his arm halfway.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Strewth!&rdquo; he
said again, but even more emphatically; and then spun round on
his heel and began to retrace his way along Fore Street at a pace
in marked contrast to his previous gait.</p>
<p>Regardless of the ill-concealed amazement of <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>acquaintances, Mr. Dobb cantered wildly adown the
pavement until he reached his abode, and here he breathlessly
flung himself through the doorway, locking the portal behind him
in a manner which clearly indicated panic.&nbsp; Mrs. Dobb,
appearing in surprise from the back parlour, addressed a very
natural question to her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and then stopped and stared
at his wife as though the situation had suddenly unfolded itself
to exhibit a further cause for consternation.</p>
<p>And next he frenziedly unlocked the door and plucked the
portal open, and plunged out again into the street.&nbsp; Glimpse
of a figure in the distance served efficiently as spur, and Mr.
Dobb raced wildly away in the opposite direction.&nbsp; Not until
he had swerved round three successive corners did he feel
emboldened to moderate his pace, and even then he travelled at
something approximating a canter.</p>
<p>But at last he came to the region of the harbour, and reaching
the &ldquo;Flag and Pennant&rdquo; shipway, he vigorously
semaphored for the attendance of the ferryman stationed
there.&nbsp; On his hasty arrival, that functionary found himself
directed to take Mr. Dobb across the river with the utmost
possible speed.</p>
<p>Mr. Samuel Clark, the ferryman, well used to the vagaries of
his present patron and former shipmate of the &ldquo;Jane
Gladys,&rdquo; made no immediate comment, but assisted his
passenger into the boat and began to transport him with
commendable energy.&nbsp; Mr. Dobb, removing his high collar and
thrusting it into his pocket, made the noises of one narrowly
saved from suffocation, and gazed fearfully over his shoulder at
the receding river bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t got the breath to
hexplain now, Sam,&rdquo; <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>he puffed, presently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Put me down over there by the &lsquo;Red Lion,&rsquo; and
then go back and make up a yarn.&nbsp; And get some one to take
your place.&nbsp; And then go and fetch Peter Lock and Joe
Tridge, and bring &rsquo;em over yonder to me at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doings?&rdquo; asked Mr. Clark, with the liveliest
expectancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not &rsquo;alf!&rdquo; was Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s
reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not &rsquo;alf!&rdquo; he said again; and
shivered perceptibly.</p>
<p>In face of this discouraging reply, Mr. Clark had not the
hardihood to press for more explicit information.&nbsp; Ever one
to concede that there was a wrong time and a right time to appeal
to Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s confidence, the look on that
gentleman&rsquo;s face warned him that this was indubitably one
of the wrong times.</p>
<p>In pondering silence, therefore, did the plump and ancient
ferryman bend his best efforts to conveying Mr. Dobb to the
further side of the harbour, and when this had been achieved, he
immediately put about to accord loyal and unquestioning
fulfilment to the remainder of Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s instructions.</p>
<p>Well within the hour, Mr. Clark returned in convoy of Mr.
Tridge and Mr. Lock, and the three entered the presence of Mr.
Dobb in the otherwise vacant tap-room of the &ldquo;Red
Lion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb had recovered some meed of his composure in the
interval, but the rosiness of complexion induced by violent
exercise had now faded to an ascetic pallor, and his eyes looked
up dully from deep and dark circles.&nbsp; Evidence of his mental
state was afforded by the fact that he was sitting on his ornate
hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lummy, &rsquo;Orace, you <i>do</i> look upset!&rdquo;
observed Mr. Tridge, in concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks real downright bad,&rdquo; asserted Mr.
Lock.</p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;E looks &rsquo;orrible,&rdquo; was Mr.
Clark&rsquo;s contribution.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, gazing with lack-lustre eyes from one to the other
of his old shipmates, shook his head forlornly and gave vent to a
sigh of extraordinary duration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, &rsquo;e looks as if &rsquo;e&rsquo;d seen a
ghost,&rdquo; declared Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;ave,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
just what I &rsquo;ave seen.&nbsp; A ghost&mdash;a real live
ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tridge threw a startled glance at the empty tumbler
standing before Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb,
comprehending. &ldquo;That is only the third I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad
all day.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a real ghost I&rsquo;ve seen.&nbsp; A
ghost from out of the past,&rdquo; he ended, with a fugitive
gleam of pride in the quality of this phrase.</p>
<p>Mr. Lock, his head a little on one side, speculatively
scrutinized this beholder of visions.&nbsp; Mr. Tridge and Mr.
Lock stared at each other in a baffled way, and privately
intimated a mutual disbelief in the sanity of their friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
&rsquo;ere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which she?&rdquo; cried Mr. Tridge, not without
perturbation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Oo do you <i>think</i>?&rdquo; dallied Mr.
Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not&mdash;not that widder woman from Teignmouth, that
Mrs. Larstick?&rdquo; queried Mr. Clark, shakily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not <i>&rsquo;er</i>?&nbsp; That I do &rsquo;ope.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s &rsquo;er?&rdquo; he begged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-n-n-nor y-y-y-yet th-th-th-that&mdash;&rdquo;
stammered Mr. Tridge, clearly lacking full control of his
jaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the dooce don&rsquo;t you say straight out,
&rsquo;Orace?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb swallowed convulsively and steadied himself by taking
a firm grip on the arms of his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s Looie Radling,&rdquo; he
announced.</p>
<p><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>&ldquo;Oh, <i>&rsquo;er</i>!&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge,
swiftly reassured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nice little bit of goods,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Werry nice,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Clark, in equal
relief.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a pleasure to meet &rsquo;er
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lock, smiling, readjusted the set of his necktie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but &rsquo;ave you forgot?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Dobb, incredulously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Talking like that!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ave you forgot or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgot what?&rdquo; returned Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Mr. Dobb replied, wretchedly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hengaged to that gal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But &rsquo;ow can you be, &rsquo;Orace?&rdquo; very
reasonably contended Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re married
to your missis, and she&rsquo;s a very &rsquo;ealthy-looking
lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I married my missis a bit sudden, about eight months
ago, as you may remember,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, it wasn&rsquo;t in reason you could afford to
miss the chance of owning a nice little shop like
&rsquo;ers,&rdquo; pointed out Mr. Tridge, extenuatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; acquiesced Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Only&mdash;only I &rsquo;appened by chance to be hengaged
to Looie Radling at the time.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d been hengaged to
&rsquo;er two months and more when I first met my
missis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And stayed be&rsquo;ind and got married to &rsquo;er by
special licence and took up life ashore, while us other chaps
went on in the &lsquo;Jane Gladys&rsquo; the last month afore she
was sold,&rdquo; recalled Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;I remember
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I seem to remember something about you being
engaged to a Miss Radling,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Lock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Greenwich gal, ain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and I remember &rsquo;er coming down to the boat
to meet you the first time we went back there, and you
wasn&rsquo;t with us no longer.&nbsp; Very surprised but quite <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>the lady
she was,&rdquo; said Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;We told &rsquo;er
you&rsquo;d deserted or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, she&rsquo;s tracked me down now,&rdquo; said
Mr. Dobb; and made fretful gestures and noises for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you&rsquo;re married now, and there&rsquo;s
an end of it,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Tridge, soothingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just where you&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo;
complained Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now Looie Radling&rsquo;s found
me out there won&rsquo;t be a end to it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be the
start, not the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breach o&rsquo; promise!&rdquo; cried Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course, I &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t thought of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;As she got any of your letters, though?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Clark, acutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Undreds!&rdquo; groaned Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t half get some damages out of
you,&rdquo; prophesied Mr. Lock, cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Having
a business of your own now, and doing so well, they&rsquo;ll
award her a real big sum.&nbsp; Three or four &rsquo;undred, I
dare say,&rdquo; he hazarded, yawning carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; screamed Mr. Dobb, in consternation.
&ldquo;Why, I can&rsquo;t lay &rsquo;ands on a quarter of
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t suppose you can,&rdquo; agreed Mr.
Lock. &ldquo;But then I ain&rsquo;t the judge and jury.&nbsp;
They won&rsquo;t believe you in court, you being so well known in
Shore&rsquo;aven.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have to sell up your
business and go back to sea, and pay her the damages in
instalments.&nbsp; Long, long years ahead from now you&rsquo;ll
still be scraping together to pay her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up!&rdquo; bellowed Mr. Dobb, rendered almost
hysterical by contemplation of so doleful a prospect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she see you in <i>them</i> clothes,
&rsquo;Orace?&rdquo; asked Mr. Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, then,
that&rsquo;s done it!&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll be after you like a
porous-plaster for them damages.&nbsp; Gals don&rsquo;t get the
chance of marrying himitation dooks every <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>day,&rdquo;
he went on, a little maliciously.&nbsp; &ldquo;And when they
&rsquo;ave the chance and loses it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if only she&rsquo;d seen you in your shirt-sleeves
and your old trowsis,&rdquo; put in Mr. Clark, &ldquo;very likely
she&rsquo;d only &rsquo;ave thought &lsquo;good riddance to bad
rubbish,&rsquo; and thought no more about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, and that ain&rsquo;t all, neither,&rdquo; said Mr.
Dobb, miserably.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going to &rsquo;appen
when my missis &rsquo;ears about it?&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t ever
&rsquo;ear the last of it!&nbsp; If them two females was to
meet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s men in your position &rsquo;ave drownded
themselves, &rsquo;Orace,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Tridge,
tonelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the only way out of it that I can
see,&rdquo; observed Mr. Lock, with brutal frankness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did trust women!&rdquo; vehemently cried aloud
Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great thing, I should say,&rdquo; mentioned Mr.
Lock, &ldquo;is to keep from kicking and struggling.&nbsp; Just
keep quiet, and when you go down for the third time it&rsquo;ll
be all over.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard say that it&rsquo;s really
rather a pleasant feeling, once you get over your mouth being
full of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, setting his palms on his knees, turned and stared
coldly at Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I shall always remember how you&rsquo;re looking at
me, &rsquo;Orace,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock, gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sort
of sad and mournful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; vouchsafed Mr. Clark,
thoughtfully&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose as you can&rsquo;t prove a
hallybee, &rsquo;Orace?&nbsp; I done that once, and it come off
all right, and we had the goose that very same night for
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something could be done,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it could.&nbsp; Only, of course, it&rsquo;s
&rsquo;ard thinking when you&rsquo;re thirsty.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>&ldquo;You think away!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see you
ain&rsquo;t thirsty!&rdquo; eagerly promised Mr. Dobb; and
forthwith gave orders which appreciably increased sympathy for
him in his tribulation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To begin with, you&rsquo;re sure she recognized you,
&rsquo;Orace?&rdquo; pressed Mr. Tridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see &rsquo;er regular jump at sight of me,&rdquo;
asserted Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Clark,
&ldquo;it was your clothes she saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next thing,&rdquo; continued Mr. Tridge, &ldquo;what
makes you think she&rsquo;s tracked you down special?&nbsp; It
may be the biggest haccident &rsquo;er being &rsquo;ere and
coming across you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she may &rsquo;ave forgotten you,&rdquo; put
forward Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;After all, it&rsquo;s eight
months and more since you saw her last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;s got married, too,&rdquo; said Mr.
Lock, hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there, I never thought of that!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mr. Dobb, brightening.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bit fickle it would be,
though, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he went on in accents slightly
flavoured with disapproval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock, &ldquo;the best
thing would be to find out just how the land lies.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re a pretty good hand at that sort of thing, Sam.&nbsp;
Suppose you was to go over and look about, and see if you could
see her and have a little chat with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Sam!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got a nacheral
gift of tact!&rdquo; fawned Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;You cut on
back over to the town, and see if you can find &rsquo;er and
learn what&rsquo;s in the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are!&rdquo; acquiesced Mr. Clark, very
readily.&nbsp; <a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>&ldquo;I shall want a couple of bob to stand &rsquo;er
a cup of tea and so forth, though.&nbsp; You can only get women
really chatty when they&rsquo;re drinking tea.&nbsp; Better make
it &rsquo;alf a crown, &rsquo;Orace, in case she fancies a bun or
whatnot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A vivid light is thrown on the state of Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s mind
when it is mentioned that, with no more demur than a sigh and a
shake of the head, he dropped two shillings into Mr.
Clark&rsquo;s extended palm, and silently added two threepenny
pieces when that gentleman did not move at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be as quick as ever I can,&rdquo; promised
Mr. Clark, in going.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere,&rdquo; he sternly
warned Mr. Dobb, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you go a-doing anything rash
while I&rsquo;m away, and give me all me trouble for
nothing!&nbsp; Wait till I come back, at any rate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The envoy departed, and a couple of hours passed before his
friends saw him again.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Mr. Tridge and Mr. Lock
had devoted the interval to the benevolent purpose of cheering up
Mr. Dobb, and so successful had they been that Mr. Clark, on his
return, stood awhile at the threshold of the &ldquo;Red
Lion&rdquo; tap-room to listen in amazement to the careless mirth
within.</p>
<p>For Mr. Dobb, fully persuaded by his companions that the
encounter with Miss Radling did not necessarily presage evil, had
become even more eloquent than they in voicing the folly of
meeting trouble half-way.&nbsp; And now, drawing equally on
reminiscence and invention, the three were exchanging diverting
anecdotes concerning occasions when alarm had proved groundless.
Mr. Tridge had just concluded a droll story about a cheese in a
sack, a policeman, a runaway horse, and <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>himself,
and Mr. Dobb and Mr. Lock were chuckling very heartily at the
d&eacute;nouement, when Mr. Clark thrust open the door of the
tap-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, &rsquo;Orace!&rdquo; he observed,
significantly. &ldquo;You laugh while you can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these ill-omened words, the merriment faded abruptly, and
Mr. Dobb was distinctly heard to groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seed &rsquo;er,&rdquo; announced Mr. Clark;
and advancing, patted Mr. Dobb thrice on the shoulder, very
slowly, and solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; hotly cried Mr. Tridge, with due
understanding of this action, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a mink!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what she is&mdash;a mink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take my advice, &rsquo;Orace,&rdquo; recommended
Mr. Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hostralia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little wait while the quailing Mr. Dobb was
sorrowfully regarded by his three friends, as though even now
they were bidding him farewell on his departure to the
Antipodes.&nbsp; Mr. Dobb gazed back, horror-struck, at each of
his three companions in turn, and when his glance rested upon Mr.
Lock, that gentleman rose and shook hands with him with a long
and lingering clasp.&nbsp; And then Mr. Dobb shakily emptied each
of the glasses on the table before him, and no one had the
hardness of heart to bid him nay.</p>
<p>And next, Mr. Clark proceeded to narrate his interview with
Miss Radling.&nbsp; He had found her, it transpired, in the High
Street, and had at length managed to recall himself to her
memory, a task which had been rendered a little protracted by the
fact that Miss Radling gave but superficial attention to him at
first, being more zealously employed in taking close heed of the
faces of all male passers-by.</p>
<p><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>When,
however, Miss Radling had recognized Mr. Clark as an old
acquaintance of the &ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo; she had expressed
the keenest satisfaction in meeting him, and had at once asked
for the address of Mr. Horace Dobb.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark immediately professed ignorance of Mr. Dobb&rsquo;s
whereabouts, but pretended to a vague belief that the late cook
of the &ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo; was now somewhere in
Scotland.&nbsp; Miss Radling promptly controverted this, stating
with complete certainty that she had herself seen Mr. Dobb in
Shorehaven during that very afternoon.&nbsp; She had also added,
with sinister vehemence, that she intended to see Mr. Dobb again
and again before she had finished with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;but what for?&rdquo; interposed the
miserable Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I says to her,&rdquo; responded Mr.
Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;What for?&rsquo; I says.&nbsp; And she
says as &rsquo;ow you was hengaged to &rsquo;er, and you
&rsquo;adn&rsquo;t wrote &rsquo;er a line for months.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Though,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;the letters &rsquo;e wrote
me before that is quite enough to do the trick.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
kept &rsquo;em all,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m going
to get even with &rsquo;im some&rsquo;ow.&nbsp; Either
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s got to put the banns up or else I goes to the
best lawyer in Shore&rsquo;aven.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found out, by
chance, that &rsquo;Orace Dobb is living in these parts,
and,&rsquo; says she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, &rsquo;ow the dooce did she find that out?&rdquo;
questioned Mr. Tridge, wrathfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t the &lsquo;Raven&rsquo; in &rsquo;arbour
here a fortnight or so after you settled into your shop,
&rsquo;Orace?&rdquo; put forward Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was!&rdquo; bellowed Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
there&rsquo;s a nasty, low, mean, under&rsquo;and, sneaking trick
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; said Mr. Clark, &ldquo;she
&rsquo;asn&rsquo;t got your <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>correct address.&nbsp; She said
she&rsquo;d been looking all over the town for a shop with Dobb
on it.&nbsp; And nacherally I didn&rsquo;t tell &rsquo;er that
the board still showed your wife&rsquo;s name of Goffley.&nbsp;
And she didn&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;re married yet,
neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you just see them &lsquo;Raven&rsquo; chaps
a-grinning when they fixed all this up for me?&rdquo; growled Mr.
Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she seem sort of forgiving at all, Sam?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me, no!&rdquo; returned Mr. Clark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Quite the contrary, in fact.&nbsp; You oughter seen the
way she folded &rsquo;er lips.&nbsp; A nice-spoken,
pleasant-looking, ladylike gal like that, too!&nbsp; I was
surprised &rsquo;ow sharp and determined she could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now Mr. Clark, with considerable pride in his diplomacy,
proceeded to speak of the clever foundations he had laid for an
alibi.&nbsp; Insisting that Mr. Dobb was not within a hundred
miles of Shorehaven, he had admitted to Miss Radling that the
remaining members of the &ldquo;Jane Gladys&rdquo; crew now
resided in the town.&nbsp; This, he suggested to her, might
explain matters.&nbsp; Confusion of identity, he had reminded
her, was of frequent occurrence among the mercantile marine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But I see &rsquo;Orace with my very own
eyes,&rsquo; she says, and goes on to describe the very clothes
you&rsquo;re wearing, &rsquo;Orace,&rdquo; continued Mr.
Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;that just
shows &rsquo;ow wrong you are!&nbsp; Them clothes is the clothes
worn by Peter Lock on &rsquo;igh days and &rsquo;olidays,&rsquo;
I says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lock uttered an exclamation denoting surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I chose you because you was always the dressy one
on the &lsquo;Jane Gladys,&rsquo; Peter,&rdquo; explained Mr.
Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;That there&rsquo;s Peter Lock in
&rsquo;is Sunday clothes you saw,&rsquo; I tells &rsquo;er,
&lsquo;and you mistook &rsquo;im for &rsquo;Orace Dobb. <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>You&rsquo;ve forgot what &rsquo;Orace looked like, and
Peter Lock &rsquo;aving been on the &lsquo;Jane Gladys,&rsquo; to
your knowledge&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; approved Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lend you these &rsquo;ere clothes,
Peter, for a hour or two, if you takes care of &rsquo;em, and you
can meet &rsquo;er in them and prove old Sam was
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, you can <i>try</i> to,&rdquo; said Mr. Clark,
soberly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must say she didn&rsquo;t look altogether
convinced, as it might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mr. Dobb, already excitedly divesting himself of his coat
and waistcoat was paying no heed.&nbsp; And Mr. Lock, delicately
massaging the nape of his neck with a forefinger, was immersed in
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit!&rdquo; he requested, coldly, at last.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Seems to me, if I don&rsquo;t help you now, &rsquo;Orace,
you&rsquo;re in a tight corner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m lucky to &rsquo;ave a true friend like
you, Peter!&rdquo; babbled Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wonder if
they&rsquo;ve got a outhouse they can lend us for a few
minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve got a motto, too, ain&rsquo;t you,
&rsquo;Orace?&rdquo; went on Mr. Lock, in steely accents.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Strictly business&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what
has been your motto ever since you went into your shop,
ain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Oh, you&rsquo;ve drove it home to us often
enough when it&rsquo;s been convenient to you and ill-convenient
to us.&nbsp; Well, my motto&rsquo;s going to be &lsquo;strictly
business&rsquo; now!&rdquo; he ended, firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo; invited Mr. Dobb, ceasing to struggle
with a bootlace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning I don&rsquo;t borrer clothes from nobody to
help &rsquo;em out of trouble.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; If you want me to
help you, you&rsquo;ve got to give me that rig-out.&nbsp;
See?&nbsp; Otherwise I shouldn&rsquo;t dream of putting it on for
a single moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>Mr.
Dobb agitatedly stigmatized this as blackmail and robbery, and
Mr. Lock quite unemotionally agreed with him in this view, but
declined to be affected by it.&nbsp; Mr. Tridge and Mr. Clark,
with eyes that glistened admiringly on Mr. Lock, said that, to
them, it seemed a very fair bargain.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Mr. Dobb and Mr. Lock made an exchange of
vesture in an outhouse.&nbsp; Mr. Dobb somewhat huffily declined
to agree with Mr. Tridge and Mr. Clark in their openly expressed
opinion that Mr. Lock looked a real toff in the hirsute
garments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stroll along with Peter and &rsquo;ave a
look for Miss Radling,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge, as the quartet
took their places in the ferry-boat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
able to back him up by saying you don&rsquo;t live anywhere in
these parts.&nbsp; As for you, you&rsquo;d better stay at
&rsquo;ome while she&rsquo;s in the town,
&rsquo;Orace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay at &rsquo;ome?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going straight to
bed,&rdquo; declared Mr. Dobb, &ldquo;and I ain&rsquo;t coming
down again till the coast is quite clear, neither!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You leave it to me and Peter.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll convince
&rsquo;er all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That same evening Mr. Dobb lay fretfully in bed, suffering
from a vague ailment which, he averred, was not serious enough to
demand a doctor, but too serious to permit of Mrs. Dobb&rsquo;s
ministrations as a nurse.&nbsp; In these circumstances, two
visitors who called to see Mr. Dobb were about to be sent away by
his wife, when Mr. Dobb, who happened to be standing at his open
bedroom door, gave orders that they should ascend to his
apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he asked, breathlessly, as Mr. Tridge and
Mr. Lock entered, &ldquo;&rsquo;ave you convinced
&rsquo;er?&nbsp; Is she gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>&ldquo;No, she ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Tridge,
regretfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s looking for a situation in
the town.&nbsp; And, do you know, I don&rsquo;t believe she quite
took in what we told &rsquo;er about mistaking Peter for
you.&nbsp; I believe she&rsquo;s sharper than we
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to make &rsquo;er believe
it!&rdquo; wrathfully snapped Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if she&rsquo;s the sort you can <i>make</i> do
anything,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A most determined young person,&rdquo; said Mr.
Tridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;When she makes up &rsquo;er mind, I should
say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t half bitter against you,
&rsquo;Orace,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;You ought to
hear the things she said about you!&nbsp; What was that bit she
told us about the bag of sweets, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to &rsquo;ear about sweets!&rdquo;
exclaimed Mr. Dobb, impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to
&rsquo;ear about &rsquo;er plans!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she <i>said</i> she was going to try for two
&rsquo;undred and fifty,&rdquo; replied Mr. Tridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Soon as ever she knew where to find you, she said, she was
coming round to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, in an excess of nervous depression, dived beneath
the bedclothes, moaning faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This I will say,&rdquo; maintained Mr. Lock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Them chaps on the &lsquo;Raven&rsquo; have gone a bit
beyond a joke this time.&nbsp; Well, so-long, &rsquo;Orace!&nbsp;
Keep smiling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our best for you,&rdquo; promised Mr.
Tridge. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep on telling &rsquo;er she was
mistook this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep on letting &rsquo;er see you in them clothes,
Peter, till she sees she&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; directed Mr. Dobb,
reappearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to meet her to-morrow afternoon in
them,&rdquo; <a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>replied Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to help
her look for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere!&rdquo; croaked Mr. Dobb, in alarm; and
then, at sight of Mr. Lock&rsquo;s humorous eyelid, he smiled
wanly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a artful one, Peter!&rdquo; he
stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am!&rdquo; agreed Mr. Lock; and followed Mr. Tridge
down the stairs.</p>
<p>Next evening, when Mr. Lock again called to report progress,
Mr. Dobb was still clinging to the sanctuary of bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you ain&rsquo;t found me yet, then?&rdquo; he
asked, with effort to be cheerful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Lock, grinning.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been looking all over the place for you,
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t she losing &rsquo;eart yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say she is,&rdquo; returned Mr. Lock,
sorrowfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;It only seems to make &rsquo;er firmer
in mind.&nbsp; If you only knew how the soles of my feet was
aching!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She still thinks I&rsquo;m about, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s sure of it.&nbsp; She says she ain&rsquo;t
going to give up looking for you till she&rsquo;s found you, if
it takes ten years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s hobstinicy!&rdquo; growled Mr. Dobb,
dashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing, she ain&rsquo;t going to find you as long as
I&rsquo;m helping her to look,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So it&rsquo;ll be a long job, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for nothing!&nbsp; I suppose you fancies
yourself, walking about in all them la-de-da clothes with a
attractive young female?&rdquo; harshly suggested Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wonder, Peter,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Dobb,
sitting up suddenly and striving to sound casual&mdash;&ldquo;I
wonder you don&rsquo;t take up with &rsquo;er
yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t afford it, for one thing,&rdquo;
said Mr. Lock, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walking about in a suit of clothes you&rsquo;ve
&rsquo;ad give to you don&rsquo;t cost much,&rdquo; contended Mr.
Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but you can&rsquo;t set up a home on a suit of
clothes!&rdquo; pointed out Mr. Lock, regretfully; and then he
laughed quite merrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I hardly know the young
lady, either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice, pretty, well-spoken girl she is, too!&rdquo;
said Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Make any man a good wife, she
would.&nbsp; I tell you straight, if I wasn&rsquo;t
married&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say, I can&rsquo;t make out how you had the
heart to do it, &rsquo;Orace,&rdquo; observed Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither can I, now!&nbsp; Serves me right!&nbsp;
I&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t ever be really worthy of
&rsquo;er.&nbsp; A nice, smart, good-looking young fellow,
that&rsquo;s &rsquo;oo she deserves for a &rsquo;usband.&nbsp; A
young fellow just like you, Peter,&rdquo; he ended softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&nbsp; Oh, I dunno!&rdquo; murmured Mr. Lock, in
confused modesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do!&rdquo; cried Mr. Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
take my advice, my boy, and go in and win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave everything nice and clear for you, eh?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about myself,&rdquo;
said Mr. Dobb. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so selfish as all that,
Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, what&rsquo;s the good of talking?&rdquo;
demanded Mr. Lock, irritably.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford
to set up house-keeping.&nbsp; Where am I to get the furniture
from for a start off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you can run up a bill with me!&rdquo; quickly
proffered Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t my idea, starting married life in
debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>&ldquo;Well, I&mdash;I might give you a few things as a
wedding present.&nbsp; Jugs and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind taking up with
her,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;Looie-Miss
Radling&mdash;she&rsquo;s just my sort, and I don&rsquo;t mind
admitting that I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about her since I met her
yesterday.&nbsp; But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and to think that you was a &rsquo;ardy
British mariner once!&rdquo; urgently cried Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You go in and win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it&rsquo;ll cost me all of fifty quid to set
up a home,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock, gazing squarely at Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; For a long time Mr. Dobb defiantly held Mr.
Lock&rsquo;s regard, and then he glanced away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, after all,&rdquo; added Mr. Lock, softly,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;ll come cheaper for <i>you</i>,
&rsquo;Orace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you&rsquo;re after!&rdquo; rasped Mr.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Call that friendship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock, honestly, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a sort of pupil of yours,
&rsquo;Orace, and I calls it &lsquo;strictly
business&rsquo;!&nbsp; However, we were <i>only talking</i>,
after all.&nbsp; Good-night, old sport, and sleep
well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two days elapsed.&nbsp; Mr. Dobb, attaining sufficient
convalescence, had left his couch and spent most of his time
behind his window curtain, watching the traffic of the street in
considerable trepidation.&nbsp; And whenever the shop-bell
jangled Mr. Dobb crept silently to the head of the stairs and
stood there to listen with bated breath till persuaded that there
was no cause for alarm.</p>
<p>Mr. Lock had not visited him once during those two days, and
the only news he had derived of that gentleman was from Mr.
Tridge, who, paying a brief visit, let fall the information that
Mr. Lock and Miss Radling had been observed together at a
matin&eacute;e performance at the local kinema theatre.</p>
<p><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>Mrs.
Dobb had just locked the little shop for the night, and Mr. Dobb,
upstairs, was feeling a consequent measure of relief, when the
private bell rang.&nbsp; Mr. Dobb, as though pulled by the same
wire, at once listened at the top of the stairs.&nbsp; Hearing
only the voices of his wife and Mr. Lock, Mr. Dobb summoned the
callers upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you&rsquo;d like to know,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock,
entering the room and carefully closing the door, &ldquo;me and
Looie have fixed it all up this very afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Mr. Dobb, joyously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
there&rsquo;s quick work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see I was wrong now to suggest about that fifty quid
to you, &rsquo;Orace,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock, penitently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it!&rdquo; begged Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never give it another thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know now I was wrong,&rdquo; repeated Mr.
Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;Looie pointed it out to me soon as ever I told
&rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, a nice, sensible, right-minded girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; as she says, if we wants money to set up
housekeeping with, let&rsquo;s wait till after&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After what?&rdquo; asked Mr. Dobb, as Mr. Lock
stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, till after she&rsquo;s got her breach of promise
damages out of you.&nbsp; She reckons on at least a hundred and
fifty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but now she&rsquo;s hengaged to you
she&rsquo;s got no claim on <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll only have your word at the court that
she&rsquo;s hengaged to me, &rsquo;Orace.&nbsp; We ain&rsquo;t
told no one else yet,&rdquo; observed Mr. Lock, happily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By the way, I&rsquo;m bringing her round to see you
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll never get a hundred and fifty pounds out
of <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but she&rsquo;ll have a jolly good try to!&nbsp; In
any <a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>case, I bet she don&rsquo;t get less than a clear
fifty, so we shan&rsquo;t be no worse off,&rdquo; said Mr.
Lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;And on the other hand, your
missis&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dobb, with his hands clasped at the back of that garment
he euphemistically described as a dressing-gown, stalked moodily
about the bedroom for a few moments.&nbsp; The voice of Mrs.
Dobb, engaged in a trifling dispute with a neighbour, came
shrilly up to him and he shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m beat!&rdquo; he yielded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Talk about nourishing a viper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call round to-morrow morning and go to the
bank with you, &rsquo;Orace,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock.</p>
<p>And it was so.</p>
<p>In rather less than six weeks&rsquo; time the wedding of Mr.
Peter Lock and Miss Louise Radling was solemnized.</p>
<p>The occurrence is still remembered in Shorehaven, very largely
on account of the extreme height and niggardly circumference of
Mr. Samuel Clark&rsquo;s top-hat, and for the remarkable
exhibition of agility given by the best man, Mr. Joseph Tridge,
out in the High Street, towards the close of the festivities.</p>
<p>Mr. Horace Dobb, an old friend of the bridegroom and bride,
attended the ceremony, in company with Mrs. Horace Dobb.&nbsp;
Many people subsequently expressed the opinion that Mr. Dobb took
the affair far too seriously for a mere guest.</p>
<p>It was just before Mr. and Mrs. Peter Lock were setting forth
on their honeymoon that the newly fledged husband summoned Mr.
Dobb aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be sure to come and see us in our little
&rsquo;ome when we come back, &rsquo;Orace,&rdquo; said Mr. Lock,
fondly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure no one&rsquo;s got a better
right among our pals to sit on them tables and
chairs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; growled Mr. Dobb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t rub it in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just want to tell you something, though.&nbsp; You
know that motto of yours what you&rsquo;ve got painted on a board
hanging in your shop?&nbsp; &lsquo;Strictly business,&rsquo; it
says, don&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Well, mottoes is like
curses&mdash;they come home to roost sometimes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo; loftily queried Mr. Dobb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I felt so sorry for Looie when she come down to
the old &lsquo;Jane Gladys&rsquo; to ask for you, and you&rsquo;d
jilted her, that I&mdash;I got sort of writing to her to cheer
her up; and before long we got engaged.&nbsp; Oh, four or five
months ago it must have been, though we didn&rsquo;t tell
anybody!&nbsp; You see, I&rsquo;d got an idea up my sleeve, and I
was only waiting till my wages was raised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then&mdash;then really she was hengaged to
you when she come to Shore&rsquo;aven?&rdquo; queried Mr. Dobb,
in a stifled voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was.&nbsp; Why, it was me who managed the whole
thing.&nbsp; It was me who wrote and told her to come to
Shore&rsquo;aven.&nbsp; It was me who told her what to say to Sam
and Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo; breathed Mr.
Dobb, irately; and then became aware of the approach of Mrs.
Dobb.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mind you don&rsquo;t miss your
train,&rdquo; he finished, lamely.</p>
<p>Late that same evening Mr. Dobb took a small lettered board
off a nail in his shop.&nbsp; In grim silence he surveyed its
legend of &ldquo;Strictly Business!&rdquo; . . .</p>
<p>Mrs. Dobb, coming down next morning to light the kitchen fire,
found that self-same panel, neatly chopped into very small
pieces, lying ready to her hand in the fender.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
